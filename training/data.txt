p	I have heard a lot about this classic and so couldn't stop buying.It's about the lessons that two children Jem and Scout learn in their life as they grow.Here are some of the beautiful words that I admire from the book: 1."shoot all the bluejays you want,if you can hit'em but remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird " 2.you don't understand someone until you put yourself in their shoes 3.It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.You rarely win,but sometimes you do. 4.but before I can live with other folks I've to live with myself. The narrator puts this at the end: "There's nothing much to learn now anyways,except probably algebra".That's what even you feel when you finish it and remember that it's a CLASSIC.Go for it without a second thought.
p	I think it's a pirated copy. The page quality is very poor and overall book binding is not so good. I am giving it four star only because this is a very good book.
p	I had ordered this initially for my niece but ended up reading it myself. The book is a great read: especially for mature teenagers. It is a charming story and takes you to a quaint old world where elders and women are shown due respect, notwithstanding the racial tensions. The author has  the rare capability to shownegative characters in a positive light. The print quality is decent enough for the price.
p	A wonderful story written from a little girl's point of you. Relived every moment of my childhood reading it. This one my altime favourite in classics. Author  succeeded completely in showcasing racism, the vulnerability of those affected by it and the resistance to change against racial discrimination in his time sensibly. A must read by everyone. Can't give anything less than 5. Happy reading
p	Beautiful read. you will go back to your childhood while you read. Characters are so nicely constructed that you will wish you had them in your life. considering the time this classic was written and its kind school-teacher like stand against racism, this book is simply "brilliant". Loved reading it. Will read it again and again. will occupy a special spot in my bookshelf forever! :)
n	I wasn't expecting sucha poor quality product from amazon. The quality of the pages is terrible.  Its like an old book issued from the library..
n	It's a very good book. Harper Lee has beautifully described the thoughts of a kid. A must read. PS : The rating is for the content of the book and not the book itself. PPS : I didn't like the quality of the page of the book that was delivered to me.
n	Service was good.... but product quality was poor.....
n	The book is small in size, but the print is solid and legible. The cover has an embossed feel to it which is a plus. It came with a bookmark and the discount made the whole deal a good buy.
n	paper quality is poor, looks like pirated book.
p	A great book which gives you loads of insights about critical questions of history. Why did human beings became all-too-powerful, rather than their ancestral brothers (Neanderthals) or cousins (apes)? What role did fire play in our early supremacy? How did the advent of agriculture changed human society? How did religion come about, and how did it become a binding-force (counter-intuitively) which helped human beings conquer other animals? How did money and consumerism flourish? At this rate of scientific progress, what's our future? Each line of this book is insightful. The writing is immensely readable. Buy this book - you will not regret it. This is the kind of history you never read - history mixed with insights from economics, biology, psychology and sociology. Reading the book will make you intellectually richer. You will look at the world differently.
p	One of the most fascinating books on the origin and evolution of the species Homo Sapiens. It is full of brilliant insights. You will likely learn something new in every chapter, if not every page. One example: What makes human beings different from all other animals and made them the masters of this planet ? According to the author, it is their ability to imagine things which do not exist and concoct elaborate fictions. This allows members of this particular species of great ape (who individually could achieve very little) to collaborate with vast numbers of other members of the species Sapiens, most of whom are perfect strangers, to achieve astonishing things from hunting down mammoths to building the International Space Station. Most of us do not realize this, but Goddess Laxmi, United States, money or Manchester United are just a few of these imaginary entities which exist ONLY in the collective imaginations of vast numbers of people and causes them to behave in certain ways and collaborate and coordinate with one another. Without mythologies there won't be any of those networks we call civilization. The more complex the civilization, the more elaborate the fictions must be. Going through the book, one is astonished by the range of author's knowledge. Although in some places the author allows his personal biases to show through, I would recommend this book very highly to all those who want a broad sweeping view of human evolution.
p	What is wonderful book. Harari sketches out the origins of our species and then goes on to describe a historically validated account of hunter gatherers traansforming into farmers and then on to workers during the industrial revolution. Frankly I found Harari's arguments unimpeachable. The only sore point is his insistence that all mammals are born heterosexual and that there is no causal link to the theory Opposite Sexes Attract. This may be as the author himself is a gay. Barring this aberration I feel the time, effort and money I invested in this book were well worth it. I would recommend it to anyone having a keen sense of history.
p	A superlative overview of major historical trends which have affected mankind. Prof. Harari's point of view is unique unusual and extremely refreshing. I enjoyed this book immensely both for its historical analysis and well argued analysis. I highly recommend it to both history buffs and even casual readers. I hope there is more from Prof Harari and I eagerly await it. I am also looking forward to a course on the same topic which he takes on Coursera.
p	This is a unique book that presents both anthropological, historical and current ways of humankind. As can be expected, the book steadily moves on from the science of biology (genes) that governed the primitives to the methods of economics (mind) that is controlling our lives. We are able to see how from local tribes we have grown into a unified sort of society. There is a clear and frank presentation of those diabolical and inhuman traits of the sapiens, coming out through their acts down the history. The book touches on what future may hold for us. On the whole, it is a very different kind of book I have read. I am happy to find that there is objectivity in what the author has to say, and even more, I was happy to find that he has a heart as he shows his leaning towards the underdogs in all situations.
n	Brilliant in parts but pretty ordinary in the rest. Dr. Harari seems to let his personal preferences get the better of himself in parts. While he talks about several myths he espouses several myths - that resources available are infinite, academics have caused progress (read Antifragile by Nassim Taleb) , scientists solve human problems, medicine has benefitted mankind (please read Death by Medicine by Gary Null). Well in parts all of these myths are true but would have appreciated Dr. Harari going into the details of conflicts of interest and other biases that prevent these institutions from doing what they are supposed to do. Did like the book in parts and several insights are remarkable but this book proves that it is very difficult for a person who has been institutionalised to write an honest account of the institution. He is too much of a scientist/academic to do justice to the true record of science/academia. A much better book on all counts would be Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
n	Well had thought it will be about human history, but the the writer has imposed his beliefs and not the history as it happened
n	this is really a good read and in phases it is brilliant.
p	This is an excellent book written by Carl Sagan. It tells us about our glorious past, the lost knowledge, the fall of our society in the medieval times and how people saved the knowledge. Also it tells us about the universe and stars in detail but any reader from non- scientific background can easily understand it. The title tells it all!!!
p	First off, Kudos to the Amazon India team. Their quality of service is amazing. I was constantly kept in the loop about the status of my package and the delivery guy promptly called me just 10 minutes before to verify whether I was home or not. About packaging, the book was wrapped in a bubble wrap which was well insulated from external environment and the rain water (It was heavily raining in Delhi when I received the order.). The whole thing was then put into your standard Amazon bag, which in itself was pretty thick. Overall, nice packaging. Now, about the book. It's frickin' awesome. Carl Sagan has been quoted many times to be the greatest science writer and popularizer ever born. This book contains the journey of our universe from that giant compressed stuff called the singularity to the present world in which we live in. This book will radically change your view and outlook on things and will flip your brain right side up! Highly recommended and must read in one's lifetime. GO FOR IT!
p	Just got it today, really a great book! But the only thing I am disappointed about is the corner of the book was damaged when I received this item, did not expect this from Amazon. Nevertheless, everything else is fine with the item, really interesting, if you are in love with Galaxies and stuff, go for it! :D
p	Thoughtfully written and narrated by the brilliant Carl Sagan, this book is all you want to know about the cosmos. When did the universe begin? When did life originate? How did galaxies evolve? When will the Sun die? These are some of the questions that the book addresses in a unique and lyrical way. Along with some magnificent pictures taken by spacecrafts that have been exploring the universe for decades, the latest edition also features a new introduction by Sagan's wife Ann Druyan and a new forward by Neil deGrasse Tyson who hosts the new documentary Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey (based on Saga's TV series from the 80s). Hailed as one of the bestselling science books of all time, I reckon it's a good buy.
p	Without a doubt, this book is the best modern sciences book ever written. It focuses not only on physics, which i actually bought it for, but biology, chemistry and even history of astronomy and science, and I never thought that that would interest me. I'm just 15, and Carl has become my idol. His lyrical, lucid language explains the most difficult concepts so effortlessly, it's hard to believe. This book is the ultimate dream come true, for anyone pursuing cosmology/astrophysics, or for even an amateur. Buy this product without any second thoughts or hesitations, you will NOT regret it at all. For all those who idolize Carl, you cannot not read this book and live life.
n	Do not buy this book. It's not worth the money. I got this hideous looking book with a hideous font and an ugly formatting. Would not recommend.
n	the book is small but thick one when you will open it many times it will tear of in many pieces.
n	A good book to read but one will get bored if he has no interest in space and universe.... Chapters are quite lengthy and require great deal of patience.... All together a good book if you want to know about origin of life on earth and how we are here.. The service by Amazon is too good. They gave huge discount and also delivered for free.... Hats off Amazon....
n	Language is too advanced for starters
n	pictures are not good ; b&w;
p	I started reading this book as the title caught my attention 'A Short History of Nearly Everything'. Well, it exceeded all my expectations. Brynson captures all the essence of life and science through the lens of a ten year old child. He does not shy away from asking very "dumb questions" regarding all nature's phenomenon, which surprisingly leads him through  time and space of mankind's understanding of nature and life's role in it. Another interesting aspect is that author has done painstaking research of 3 years to get all the stories right, thus giving credit to real inventors & discoverers. He manages all this through very humourous and insiightful commentary and takes pain to dumb down complicated concepts so we undertand its fundamentals as well as its importance. If you have not read this yet, pick one up right now and get going on this fun filled nature voyage. This book is a keeper and can be read to again to get get our stories straight !
p	Everything from the beginning of time. Here's one confusion I had - I didn't know it covered the history of everything based on SCIENCE. So a little different than what I thought - doesn't cover how civilizations came to be, how economies developed, etc. So if you're looking for something like that, this won't do it. However, it is filled more fun-stories that one can probably recollect. Enjoyed it.
p	This is one of the few books I would always recommend. This book has the maximum amount of knowledge that I've ever learnt from a book, presented in a very interesting and structured fashion. I haven't ever read a book that provides information on so many topics in such a lucid manner. All presented in an interesting storytelling manner unique of Bill Bryson!
p	A brilliantly written book in which popular writer Bill Bryson vividly describes how the world came in to existence and answers many thoughtful questions. We are taken through an epic journey right from the big bang to the rise of civilization, all explained in a plain and simple language. Through his experiences of living in several countries, Bryson gathers information from various museums, interviews many experts and visits places on earth where fossils were found or which have mysterious geographical formation. We hear many fascinating stories from different corners of the planet; and find interesting facts about the universe, the earth, the sun and other planetary bodies that have riddled mankind for many centuries. Bill Bryson is no scientist but a traveler through space and time with in-depth knowledge on science.
p	An eyeopening  journey from the depths of science i.e. from big bang to the nano world everything covered beautifully. The best part about this book is the flow which is very smooth and non technical. We would imagine that a book of this nature should have been written by a scientist. But Bill Bryson being a non scientist did a better job of bringing out scientific history in easily readable form, which a non scientific person can easily digest. This book helps us to revisit scientific subjects with a better  perspective since we have left our schools ( as i am a commerce graduate). Worth reading for every one.
n	Not a basic approach....
n	Well, when I saw the title of the book - I thought it will be indeed a short history of nearly everything but as I started reading, I realized that it's not at all short history instead it's a history of nearly everything. What we learn in this book is apart from science is how insane or competitive were the scientist who invented most of the things in science.  As titled suggested 'A Short History of nearly everything' not everything is covered in this book, for example philosophy, religion, economics, politics, medicines, computers etc. What actually covered in this book is - physics, atoms, big bang, quantum physics, gravitation, (so called) evolution, dinosaurs etc. What you learn reading this book is - what you should have learnt as a student of science. This book answers many question which we wanted to know as a child when we were in school, for example - how on earth scientist know exactly the weight of earth or how the figured to weight of atoms or how the knew the atom can be divided into quarks etc. Overall a pretty good read for anyone who wants to know about science and beware it's not short history - the book is very dense and you might need some long reading hours to complete it.
p	This book carries a lot of nostalgia. I remember my father purchasing the book and spending time to read over that. To be very honest, it was about 12 years from now. My knowledge on physics, rather on cosmology was very limited. Years pased in, but I never looked back to understand the book. I spent hours understanding the concepts of physics, tensors, linear algebra, Minkoski's space time and diagram, general relativity. As years passed, the romanticism for black holes, neutron stars vanished and what emerged out of my knowledge, is purely mathematical concepts, ideas and most importantly those abstract mathematical concepts slowly settled in my mind and took a form, a shape: Black holes, big bang or otherwise.....These again are purely mathematical concepts, later witnessed by Hubble space telescope to get evidence. For readers who are thinking that it is a very simple book, casual read, sitting on sofa or while traveling, surely this is NOT THE BOOK for you. This is a book which is written by one of the greatest scientist of our generation who has been given the honor with Einstein. Well, before understanding 'A Brief History of Time' we should understand who is writing the book. He is Dr.Hawking, the Lucasian Prof.of Mathematics, the position awarded to Sir Isaac Newton,Jospeh Larmor, George Stokes, Paul Dirac. Since 1663-2009, only 18 professors were awarded this position, one of the highest award in the world of mathematics. So, we understand what level of mathematics he would be assuming us to know. Why the book is popular? When Hawking went to Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of of astronomy books ar Cambridge University Press, he asked to drop all the equations in his draft, except one, E=mc^2. Dr.Hawking's motto was to reach to buyers in airport, specifically to the mass, which definitely would have made it half if there would have been equations and that is the reason, why the book is so difficult. If you think that you can explain mathematics in simple English, then everybody would have been Dr.Hawking. The first edition came up in 1988. In 1974, Carl Sagn recounts:"I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton....." What this book is all about? 'A Brief History of Time' is an attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the nonspecialist reader. The idea is is to give an overview of the subject but, unusual for a popular science book, it also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. What is there in the book? Chapter 1 Our Picture of the Universe: A basic idea of the history and development of cosmology starting from Ptolemy's Universe, Copernicus, Galileo to the current understanding. Chapter 2 Space & Time: Things start to become a little bit weird from this chapter. (a) Galilean relativity and measurement (b) Newton's laws of motion (c) Emerging ideas of gravity (d) James Clerk Maxwell's emergence of the famous theory of electromagnetism -- The first step towards unification, unifying 2 separate forces, electric and magnet into one. (I would recommend to read Daniel Fleisch's 'A student's guide to Maxwell's equations') Dr. Hawking then introduces, Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, how Einstein used Maxwell's equations, the constancy for the speed of light, Lorentz transformation. (I would recommend readers to have a thorough understanding of Lorentz transformation, using Euclid's postulate of h^2=b^2+p^2 and what is a Lorentz factor). Hawking introduces the idea of light cones, where the event will travel. Actually, it is better first to read Minkowski's diagram of space time before going through this chapter. Then comes the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. Here Prof.Hawking quickly introduces, Einstein's magnum opus: The General Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space time, gravity is no longer a force which Newton predicted in F=G.m1.m2/r^2, but a geometry of space time. Recommended reading: Hartle's Gravity, An Introduction to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity Chapter 3 The Expanding Universe: (a) Hubble's observation (b) Doppler effect (c) The red shift (c) Friedmann model. Here. Prof.Hawking starts introducing the concept of singularity: the extreme prediction of General relativity and his favourite subject the BLACK HOLE. The emergence of Penrose-Hawking theorem: a situation where matter is forced to be compressed and compacted to a point (a space-like singularity) and a situation where light rays come from a region with infinite curvature (time-like singularity) Chapter 4 The Uncertainty Principle: Enter the particle zoo, If you take my opinion, this chapter should have been much bigger. It basically explain, the crux of particle physics, Heinsenberg's uncertainty principle. (a) Uncertainty principle (b) Wave particle duality (c) The double-slit experiment and interference pattern and the Schrodinger equation. My dear readers, please please do read a bit of basic quantum mechanics and probability before coming to this chapter. Chapter 5: Elementary Particle & The Forces of Nature: Again, particle physics. Understanding elementary particles, quarks (which makes up proton and neutron). Electron spin, what is a half spin (+1/2 and - 1/2 spin). Integer spin for bosons, Pauli Exclusion principle => Recommended reading: [...]. Most importantly the electro-weak unification by Weinberg-Salam theory. So, we now have only 3 major forces of nature as per the Standard Model: (1)Electro-weak (a sum of electromagentism and weak force) (2) Gravity (3) Strong force. For a better understanding please look into: Dr.Mani Bhaumik's Code Name God. Chapter 6: Black Holes. Readers, please understand (1)Chandrashekhar Limit (2) Tolman-Volkoff-Oppenheimer Limit (3) What is Schwarzschild radius (4) Clear out the confusion between infinite density and infinite mass; the rest Dr.Hawking makes you understand. Recommend: Kip Thorne's Black holes and time warps. Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black. Here Dr.Hawking explores more into black holes, event horizon. For the first time, Hawking introduces his brilliant work which is called The Hawking radiation (entropy and the 2nd.law of thermodynamics) Chapter 8: The Origin and the fate of Universe: How the universe started and how it might end is talked about in this chapter. Chapter 9: The Arrow of time: Explains about disorder, entropy, the thermodynamic arrow of time. Chapter 10: The unification of physics speaks of the GUT (Grand unified theory) and Dr.Hawking's quest to unify the 3 forces of nature. He mentions that Einstein spent the final years if his life, finding such a unified field theory. Remember, when the book was written, HIGGS-BOSON was not discovered. Now the scenario is different.  Hawking opens discussion with Graviton which falls under boson, an elementary particle, following Bose-Einstein statistics and have half-integer spin. Graviton is still unconfirmed,with mass=0. He introduces string theory, supper symmetry and many advanced concepts. He writes: 'Can God make a stone so heavy that he can't lift it?' He states 3 possibilities: (1) There is a complete unified theory (2) There is no ultimate theory (3) There is no theory of the universe, events cannot be prediced  beyond a certain extent, it occurs randomly and arbitrarily. Dr.Hawking ends the book with an optimists note: 'A complete, consistent, unified theory is only the first step; our goal is a complete understanding of the events around us, and of our own existence.' 'If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason -  for then we would know the mind of God.' Happy reading !!
p	Its a miracle of nature how a physically incapable guy can be mentally so tremendously capable..!! Stephen hawking is one of those names which are labeled as "Great thinkers" and this book will tell you the reason why. Your perception of cosmos will change forever after reading this book. Another thing, unlike other complicated writers,stephen has made rocket science langauge to a child's language which will be very benificial for them who doest hav a sci background. So take ur coffee mug and get ready to embark on a journey of a new cosmos... Bon voyege... ;) Cheers..
p	Mr. Hawking is the blend product of Copernicus, Galileo and Einstein, he brings in life to the old laws of complicated dialect, he breathes on same complex principles discovered by forefathers and rolls bundles of solutions to cosmology mysteries....,
p	This is a very informative and interesting book written by a man known for his  commitments for education and science. I always wanted to have this book since its publication. Amazon made this simple and send it to my doors.
p	Excellent book by stephen hawking. It is a must read for all those who want to know more about black holes and the concept of evolution of the universe. The price by amazon is really challenging and i am sure that no one can offer this book in this price. Excellent delivery time. Overall a perfect 5 for amazon too...
n	It's the brilliant Hawking who forms the bridge between extreme physics only understandable to highly qualified scientists and the common people. But I found it out strange that almost 3/4 th of this book is SAME COPY of the book- 'The Theory of Everything'. Parts of both books are completely same. So except this point all is genius! Thumbs Up to Stephen Hawking.
n	The book starts with basic facts of physics and generate interest in reader's mind but later chapters are complex and difficult to understand for an ordinary reader But it's an effort by theoretical physicist , so he tried to make it as simple as possible and sometime using humor in between. First and last chapter is easily readable for an ordinary reader.
n	A very difficult read! Strictly for people with science background only.
n	Poor quality recycled pages, don't feel like reading the book..
n	The pages of the book is of third class..it looks yellowish & oldish.
p	This is required reading for all budding Entrepreneurs. His insights and advice are very useful for, especially high technology, entrepreneurs. One example is... bigger the market...bigger the competition it attracts. Give up obsessing on market size and Look for small niche market when you start and try to dominate it. The competition may be good for consumers but bad for business and so try to create monopoly in your sphere. Examples are Google, Tesla, Paypal, eBay, Facebook etc.
p	its a must for every budding entrepreneur and/or ambitious executive.. Once you start its difficult to put it down, the lucidity with which the counter-intuitive ideas have been explained is simply marvellous. Its 7 point check list for new business idea is simple, intuitive and effective..  Peter explains it over several chapters and then at one point lists them all at one place. The shear genius and academic rigour coupled with first hand experience at the top of the pyramid makes this book an exceptional read. It was a wonderful journey reading this book in last two days, it must be a at least a year since i finished a book in less than two days cover to cover... .
p	A masterpiece from a person who has been there, done that. How is this for starters: One question the author recommends should be asked is- "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" or its business equivalent- "what valuable company is nobody building?" I think that's powerful. Peter classifies progress into vertical progress (technology led) and horizontal progress (process led), and states that in a world of scarce resources it is only through technology that growth is sustainable. Stating that success comes from having a monopoly position, Peter identifies the elements of such a position as  proprietary technologies (or knowledge), network effect, economies of scale, and branding. The author moves between philosophy, his personal experience, advocacy, and technology to offer a compelling insight on how inventors and investors think. I personally liked the seven point check-list on starting a venture, that comprises of the following dimensions: engineering, timing, monopoly, people, distribution, durability, and secrecy. A very good read for managers and founders alike.
p	I would say it's a not that relevant in Indian market, particularly  focused on American market. Peter Thiel is a co-founder of  "paypal" therefore shares his insight on start-ups and how to grow and sustain failures while in process shares how they sold off paypal to ebay. This books also tells some good stories of great personalities like steve jobs , bill gates.
p	Peter Thiel, the cofounder of PayPal, Palantir and Venture Capitalist (Facebook,LinkedIn), offers his insights on how startups turn into successful business ventures and help build the future. Thiel is one of the profound and original thinker of our time. All his recruits are asked one simple question "What important truth you know which very few people agree with you on?" . Although his contrarian question might appears simple , its very difficult to answer. In this book,He offers many original and interesting ideas on monopoly, market, economics. I am particularly fascinated by his critique on "Competition as an ideology and a destructive force" (because the conventional wisdom propagated by economist from almost all economic school agree that competition is good for the product, market, consumer and the competitors) and all his contrarian question helps me see how biased and misinformed I am on many things. Its an important eyeopener for me and an interesting read. Highly recommended.
n	Masters and Thiel take on start ups and building up process is procedural and forward looking.Everyone has something to learn here whether a newbie or a decade old businessman
n	Good for people looking for business oriented books. Was recommended by a person conducting a workshop on business management.
n	Well its ok,a single time read,but definitely a must read for tech entrepreneurs. Not really my type.
n	An essential for a budding entrepreneur
n	Below expectations. Positive comments misguided me. Concepts explained are just having the basic logic and they are far far away from the usability in entrepreneurship. Did not find it much helpful.
p	If you are interested in starting your own business but you are trapped between job (high paid salary) and your business.. must read this! This book has changed my life. I am really happy with how Robert Kiyosaki has explained difference between thinking and implementation (action) of rich and poor.
p	Content of the book is fantastic, while the quality of the mass-market paperback edition is pathetic. Nothing more than a book sold in the road-side worth Rs. 100. If you want a quality print or you want to gift it to someone do not go for this.
p	I can genuinely say this book changed the way I look at life, career and personal development. It kinda opened my eyes. The system is rigged against the small fellow. The more I thought about it more I agreed with Rich Dad. It highlighted to me the perils of depending on salary as primary means of income in today's age. It highlighted importance of investing and generation of passive income from your investments. Rich Dad tells you to invest wisely and earn enough passive income from your investments so as to become financially free and secure. That is the path to financial nirvana. Rich Dad tells us to take responsibility for our financial future and not depend on any corporation or government. I followed many of his advice to good success. It changed my financial life. Its been now 15 years since I first read this book. Lot has been changed in these 15 years. But the advice of Rich Dad is timeless and true. If you listen to him then it will change your life too.
p	A wonderful book to read for all youngsters, those who wish to make a difference in their thinking process in terms of financial success.
p	its very usefull book for those who wants to be rich... never work for money... money should works for you..
n	Its all about making money through your assets. Author is trying to explain this thing again and again which becomes monotonous after certain chapters. I feel like I already knew these things and I would disagree with the author when he says only way to be financial independent is to start our own business. Business is always good but not the only solution.
n	A Very nicely presented book which actually has at least 5 points one can follow concretely.  Usually such books are open ended but Robert did make it a concrete one. There are repetitions but not that annoying. I feel one must read it if not to earn money but to be aware of their un necessary spendings and emotions.
n	This book is a joke, apart from telling you about strong asset building, the book wants to sell you a board game, investing in real estate is the real investment, promoting pyramid marketing scheme and selling lies. People interested further can just google, reach dad poor dad scams.
n	The book tell you once again what your grandparents did again and again, earn - save - spend. But alas, the plastic money generation simply does not understand....and later pays for it. There is some repetition. But otherwise a nice book and still relevant after so many years.
n	An easy read for everyone who is looking to understand the utility of money. The author has described it in the best way for his readers to analyse the tool which is Money. It helps to change readers perception about money.
p	UPDATED 31 December 2014 I've already reviewed this book - Think And Grow Rich ('revised and updated edition' by Arthur R Pell) Published 7 October 2004 by RHUK. But I ordered a second copy of the same title mainly after coming across a review of the revised edition on Amazon.com where one of the reviewer warned buyers to not go with newer/revised edition because it was abridged and missed a lot of information when compared with the original unabridged edition. Well I had got myself the revised/updated R Pell's edition at that time, thinking revised new print will have more content added into it. But as it turned out otherwise, I really did not want to miss a single word from Napoleon Hill's timeless classic, so I thought of going through and here's my review for the Original Unabridged 1937 Edition - Think And Grow Rich. So to answer the questions, does the updated edition which happens to be abridged miss any chapters? Surprisingly, yes. Do we lose a lot of information? Well, not really but it's a question of authorship. Let me explain, the first couple of chapters - Chapter 1: The Secret Of Success, Chapter 2: Thoughts Are Things from the 'Original Edition' are in fact missing in the Arthur R Pell's Updated Edition. I really wanted to make sure, so after going through the two chapters in the Original Edition and reading the updated edition, I learnt that Arthur R Pell has sort of paraphrased those two chapters into one single chapter called 'The Power Of Thought'- (Chapter 1 in newer edition). From then on, the Chapter titles are almost the same in both books apart from Arthur R Pell's lag a chapter behind also has updated examples/case studies. I find this not right because when I bought the newer edition book, I assumed the content would be the same and the newer edition was simply a re-print with a few more case studies/examples added to the original. It is nowhere mentioned on the book that the content itself is modified. But unfortunately, there are a lot of independent publishers who're printing Think And Grow Rich "Updated Edition". So beware of cheap reprints. But honestly speaking, Arthur R Pell has done a fair job with research looking up for newer business moguls, studying their secret to success. So I've secretly kept both the books in my shelf. Anyway going back to the book itself, this book is still my personal favourite inspiration/self-help books that I've ever read in my life. If you are looking for inspiration or something that will motivate you to go after what you desire, this book is the start and I certainly insist you to read it as soon as possible. This book is an in depth analysis on most successful people's life-stories and how they achieved acquiring such wealth. Napoleon Hill had spent decades researching the secret behind their riches. His research started as a poor journalist while working for Andrew Carnegie(Who was one of the richest American industrialists). Andrew Carnegie had asked him to write a case study on 500 most successful people like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman etc who were all interviewed by him. Napoleon Hill learnt the secret behind these people's success and their business empires which was formulated in the form of thirteen steps to achieving success. The book is not just about accumulating money but tells how one can truly achieve anything if one truly desires something wholeheartedly with faith and perseverance no matter the obstacles, in the end one is the victor of life as "Only Life Is Priceless" (Re-quoting from Titanic movie). I strongly encourage everybody to read this book no matter how old you are. Information is more less the same in both books (original and newer revised edition). There are so many books based on Napoleon Hill's success formula - it's sad they don't give enough credit. One of them I can immediately recall is The Secret By Rhonda Byrne. For any budding entrepreneur Think And Grow Rich will certainly help a great deal as Napoleon Hill's ideas are timeless and truly life changing.
p	the best self help book ever. if read with dedication can change your life. the page quality is awesome. its a good source of knowledge and inspiration. i think everyone should read it
p	Read the book not as other book.. Its a book of MAGIC. Can change ur life...Should study the book as prescribed in the book..
p	I've already reviewed this book - Think And Grow Rich ('revised and updated edition' by Arthur R Pell) Published 7 October 2004 by RHUK. But I ordered a second copy of the same title mainly after coming across a review of the revised edition on Amazon.com where one of the reviewer warned buyers to not go with newer/revised edition because it was abridged and missed a lot of information when compared with the original unabridged edition. Well I had got myself the revised/updated R Pell's edition at that time, thinking revised new print will have more content added into it. But as it turned out otherwise, I really did not want to miss a single word from Napoleon Hill's timeless classic, so I thought of going through and here's my review for the Original Unabridged 1937 Edition - Think And Grow Rich. So to answer the questions, does the updated edition which happens to be abridged miss any chapters? Surprisingly, yes. Do we lose a lot of information? Well, not really but it's a question of authorship. Let me explain, the first couple of chapters - Chapter 1: The Secret Of Success, Chapter 2: Thoughts Are Things from the 'Original Edition' are in fact missing in the Arthur R Pell's Updated Edition. I really wanted to make sure, so after going through the two chapters in the Original Edition and reading the updated edition, I learnt that Arthur R Pell has sort of paraphrased those two chapters into one single chapter called 'The Power Of Thought'- (Chapter 1 in newer edition). From then on, the Chapter titles are almost the same in both books apart from Arthur R Pell's lag a chapter behind also has updated examples/case studies. I find this not right because when I bought the newer edition book, I assumed the content would be the same and the newer edition was simply a re-print with a few more case studies/examples added to the original. It is nowhere mentioned on the book that the content itself is modified. But unfortunately, there are a lot of independent publishers who're printing Think And Grow Rich "Updated Edition". So beware of cheap reprints. But honestly speaking, Arthur R Pell has done a fair job with research looking up for newer business moguls, studying their secret to success.

p	Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill was originally written in 1937. This book is a great starting point for anyone interested in financial and personal development. The book stresses that their is no fast way to become successful, it takes hard work. But this book lays out the keys to getting you there. It's based around the principles of the Law of Attraction. The first law is Desire. Create a plan on how you will obtain a certian amount of money by a set date. See yourself already in possession of that amount of money and start the hard work to achieve your dream. The book contains much more and is a great read. I am glad I read this book and would definitely recommend it to others. Thank you for reading my review.
n	I am confused , this is not the original book which i expected to be delievered to me ! book reads that it is based on copy right free version of the title and only uses extracted material . I really don't think this book would be worth a read as it is better to read the book originally published by the author !
n	I have must respect for author. Ok making it two from one. But the book is not very coherent. Think of it like a a theoretical physics book. You won't understand it if nobody have you real life examples. Author talks off too much content. Everybody knows like hard work, dedication, determination. In the end I don't think anybody would be able to remember things from this book or apply them. He has given like 50 points etc. etc. Though at a page or two you have think you can take and even if one learns from this single page it's worth it. But in all it's clunky and just talks of theory, instead if you will read some autobiography where you can follow the life of protagonist you will gain much more.
n	i brought this book one weeks ago i found quality of the paper is very low and font size also very small...this contains duplicate pages..
n	I am giving 1 star not to the Author but the publication house. This books look like a pirated book. Very cheap paper and printing quality.
n	After going through reviews posted on this website I decided to buy this and have a go at it. But I personally think that it is a over hyped book! I regret for buying this book.Whilst reading its getting very bored and the author Is preaching like a typical indian school teachers Whilst they taking lesson in classroom.
p	The router TL-WR841N from TP-Link is just an awesome piece of technology at cheapest rate one can imagine. There are a no. of 300N Wifi routers but compared to the price and reliability it is a winner. I've been using it for the past 3 months and the following are my findings about the router: Pros:- - Good looking & compact router. - Super easy to set up. - Web based utility does a good job in controlling the router. - All required instructions for easy setup are provided. - The Stock firmware has a lot to offer. - DD WRT firmware support (Just Google 'DD WRT' for details). However, I was unable to use the feature as DD WRT firmware for V9 is not available. Also it voids warranty. - Physical Power AND Wi-Fi switch present. Which means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical LAN connection. - 4 LAN ports present. - It can also be used as range extender. - Has 2 non-detachable antennas for boosting Wi-Fi. I've installed the router in 1st floor and get 1-2 bars in ground & 2nd floor and just outside on the road. Also my tab shows 1 bar while on the roof top of my 3 storey building. So, its coverage is good to average. Data/Internet speed has little effect on the available no. of bars. - It can share loads of data via Wi-Fi & LAN network. I had successfully converted my tab into Wi-Fi virtual keyboard, mouse & gamepad/joystick. - Wall mounting can also be done. - 3 Years Replacement Warrenty. Cons:- -Well as such no serious problems have been faced till date. My only concern is its white colour which looks great but is likely to get dirty sooner or later. - Unnecessary heating problem can be avoided by installing it in an open space. Overall it is the cheapest router available in the market at present with loads of feature on offer. It is highly recommended for those who want cheap router with reliability, security & loads of features. UPDATE (1/11/15) :- The router has been working flawlessly for a year and a half now. However, I had to go for replacement twice due to no fault of mine but Act of GOD. The service of TP-Link is great. They replaced my router after testing then and there with no question asked. Though I had to carry it to there service center. Also, I can see the price has come down to half (by '600-'700). Hope this update will help in further decision making.
p	aweseome product. Works like a charm. I have a 3 BHK and it covers the entire apartment and gives a very decent speed throughout. I use it for my ACT fibrenet connection and it works great. Go for it!
p	Purchased after reading a lot of reviews from other buyers for this product. Completely satisfied with the product as per my requirements. My home is a 3 storey building with 2000 sq feet land area. I placed this Router in my 1st floor and it covers each and every corner of the building right from the ground floor to the top of my 2nd floor terrace. Though in some far rooms ( with 3-4 walls in between ) in the ground floor shows single bar but  internet speed is working fine. Its connected with 5 cell phones of my family members, 2 laptops and 5 workstation desktop in my office in 2nd floor. All are working fine with good internet speed. Already using it for more than a month. So I hope future buyers can calculate their requirements. Now about the price:  Purchased at  Rs939/- (Printed MRP on the box Rs2700/- ) on Amazon.in last month 8th July 2015. When ordered from Siliguri, West bengal, I tracked the courier process. From Bangalore it was couriered on the same day and within 2days it was to kolkata and then to Siliguri. But the delivery process from the Siliguri courier office to my home (in the same place) it took 14days. Good Amazon packaging and service .But pathetic Siliguri courier service. Amazon should consult to their delivery partners. They are ruining their reputation.
p	The best router in dual antenna segment ever I have seen
p	I had two routres at my home earlier one being main and the other one as a repeater. Ever since I bought this, I have removed all of them. Only this router which siffices the whole of the house. This is a world winner.
n	It’s been over a week since I am using this product. I am very much inclined to most of the reviewers here. Let me add some points: Background: I was using a rock-solid performer Linksys WRT 54 G for almost a decade and it continues to prove its worth. I was using Airtel broadband 2 mbps plan. I recently moved to ACT fibernet with comparable internet speeds of 42 mbps average (both download and upload). Apparently, my Linksys WRT 54 G could not deliver this speed. It could do a max of 14 mbps :( ... you know its G band after all. In practical terms, G routers can do 15 Mbps vs theoretical 54 Mbps. I wanted to move to N band router (theoretical 300 Mbps) and wanted to touch the waters and I landed up with TP Link WR841N 300Mbps. Following is my feedback: First Impression Out of the Box: Poor plastic grade. However, the fit and finish was adorable despite the poor plastic appearance & feel. Speed - Did I get my anticipated wireless 42 Mbps speed based on my ACT fiber provider? Answer: Yes & No 2 Feet - Full speed 42 Mbps internet. -- Signal Bar: Full 5 5 Feet - 37 Mbps – 5 Bar 10 Feet - 20 Mbps – 5 Bar 15 Feet - 15 Mbps – 5 Bar 20 Feet - 10 Mbps – 4 or 5 Bar 25 Feet - 5 Mbps – 3 or 4 Bar 30 Feet – 3 to 5 Mbps – Almost Dead No walls in between. Tested under line of sight conditions. Tested on free channels with various settings. In a way, this device is like a wife like material. You need to be close enough to get all the attention and at all times (Just kidding, no offence meant). I flashed the DD WRT firmware (with careful instructions) and I played around with all combinations to optimize the experience and there had been no significant change. This means, the hardware has already done its best. We cannot ask a Tiger to run like a Cheetah, can we? :) One important factor: There was not a single dropout or restart and it’s a stable device (tested for a week). Value for Money? In my opinion, I think this device has performed for what I have paid for. Can’t expect more. What Next? For folks who want solid performance (range + speed + multi device + stability) should buy top of the line AC dual band devices offered by various brands like Asus AC 87U etc. But for now they are too too too costly. Just wait and watch the market for the price to drop (maybe a year). Until then this TP Link will faithfully serve you (hopefully). :)
n	TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300Mbps Wireless N Router Good Product, used it before, but I think this seller is not selling the correct product. I had to return the product after replacement as it was defective. People who have bought it already can test this. I am getting a high pitch sound from the router when it is switching on and Wi-Fi gets connected with the default settings. People who are not sensitive of such sound, can test this with your Pet or kids. If your pets gets attentive towards the Router or trying to run from the router(scared) then you also have this problem. This kind of sound used to control pets, which are almost not audible to us, but sensitive to pet. For kids, you can just ask them whether they can hear any sound. Make sure you have a silent room. Awesome router, no doubt, but this seller might not be dealing with correct purchases. I have added a snapshot of the router my friend is using and the router I newly bought. The old router also bought from Amazon, but from a different seller. Hope people who have already bought before me, have non defective piece. Thanks...
n	So all in all let me sum up the router for somebody who doesn't want to go into details. 1) This is a single band wireless N Router. 2) Has descent range but would have loved more. Signal drops significantly because of walls and obstructions. 3) Works well for speed upto 300 Mbps. Lets face it, we in India haven't seen speeds more that 50 Mbps. 4) Installation is pretty easy. You will be able to do it yourself. 5) Is not an ADSL router, so will work with service providers which give internet through LAN cable. Does what it is supposed to do pretty well. Would have loved  to have better coverage. Overall great deal for the price. Can't really go wrong with purchase. Another option to consider is a Dual band Router. A little expensive but might be help full for some people. Now lets get to the pros and cons of a Dual band router and let me try and explain to you how it works and in which case you should get one. Lets start with the dual band thing. So you might be tempted to think a router has excellent range after all it has 3 antennas. 5dBi as the companies try and tell you should be very strong. But you will be disappointed with the results. The router has 2 antennas for the 2.4 GHz signal and one for the 5 GHz signal which will show as a different Wi-Fi signal. Let me try and explain to you why you might need dual band signal. You have signal broadcasted at different frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in a dual band router. All the Wi-fi routers have signals broadcasted at 2.4 GHz and having too many routers in a small space makes it difficult to have a good connection and the signals from your router can interfere with signal from a nearby router. So if you are staying in a apartment with many Wi-Fi signals near you, having a the options to switch to 5GHz is a great one to have. But the coverage area for the 5 GHz signal is limited as only one antenna is dedicated for the 5 GHz signal. One more thing many of us might now know is that the 2.4 GHz signal and the 5 GHz signal show us as separate Wi-Fi signals. So if you move away from the router you will have to switch from one Wi-Fi signal to the other.
n	WARNING: BUYERS BEWARE! Buyers need to be aware that the reviews that you are reading here are for different routers! There are actually SIX different models (as of 2015), in India, of this "same" router - TL-WR841N version 1, TL-WR841N version 7, TL-WR841N version 8, TL-WR841N version 9, TL-WR841N version 10 and TL-WR841N version 11.  And with each "version", TP-LINK has changed the hardware of this router. Naturally, with different hardware, the performance of the router vary a lot. Some of the reviews here are for "version 8" and below, while some are for "version 9" and above. That may explain the discrepancy in the reviews (for example, some have complained that the wifi coverage is "average", while others have said it is "good" or "excellent"). OpenWRT page on this router has a table comparing the hardware - http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd PLEASE COMPLAIN TO AMAZON.COM ABOUT THIS and request them to ensure that seller also includes the "version" in the model number, and creates separate product page for each version so that the reviews are accurate and do not mislead us customers. --- I bought another one of this router to extend my WiFi. Unfortunately, though the router supports WDS bridging it did not work. That's when I discovered that the two TL-WR841N routers I had purchased were not the same! (TP-Link themselves say that WDS bridging with different router models, from even the same company, may not work).  Last year (2014), when I had purchased this router I had got the "version 9" model and this year (2015) I received the "version 10" model. It was irritating - to ensure that I could use both routers and extend my WiFi, I then had to install a beta version of DD-WRT on my older "version 9" model, and use my mediocre router hacking skills to make everything work. ---- (My first review of the older, "version 9" model is below  ...) I had some concerns about buying a cheap modem from a Chinese company. But TP-Link seems to be a multi-national corporation and one of the top 10 players in this field. So I figured I'd take the risk. Bought and received a factory sealed, brand new item from the seller. The parcel packaging was good and the item was undamaged and worked fine as soon it was plugged in. The month and year of import was listed as "July 2014" for the item I received. For those who want to install DD-WRT please note that I received a "Version 9" model of this router, and not "Version: 8" as listed in the Amazon.com description for this router's page. Since I didn't wish to void the warranty by installing custom firmware anyway, it didn't matter to me (the TL-WR841N comes with a 3 years replacement warranty, which is great considering its price). The stock firmware offers a good enough set of options and is easily accessible through a web based interface you can use with any modern browser. The range is decent, but nothing extraordinary. My previous Linksys ADSL modem had a weak signal and thus occasionally dropped connections in the first floor. The signal on the first floor above is still weak, but the wifi connections seem more stable  with this modem. Overall, happy so far. Will update this feedback, with additional information on this routers performance, after a few months. Update: It's been 9+ months on now since I purchased this router. Since the purchase, TP - Link has released 2-3 firmware updates, and I was safely able to upgrade the router without any issues each time. Performance of the router remains satisfactory. Using it both through wifi and LAN cable, and network connection is stable and good on both. Sometimes it is on for days but it doesn't heat up much at all. CORRECTION I had earlier mentioned that I faced network connections issues while torrenting, and suspected it could be because the TP-Link router couldn't handle the number of connections that torrenting sometimes require. I may have been wrong about this as I forgot that the connection to the internet is actually provided by the ISP's modem - router, which is connected to my TP-Link device. As such, further investigation is required to check which device is actually causing the issue.
n	Range is pretty good but i ordered for black and got white
p	The actors are excellent. Bring back old memories of my own childhood with my friends. Swami is really really fun. God, what a fun time it would have been.
p	We can't live our life again but we can feel and memorize the past. Watching these stories made me happy, specially "Vendor of Sweets" and "Swami and Friends". Everyone should buy this complete set of Malgudi Days. Never miss it!
p	Brings back nostalgic feeling watching these TV adaptions of R.K.Narayan’s novels & short stories. Shankar Nag’s recreation of Malgudi and direction is amazing. In today’s clutter of empty, long running television serials, a lighthouse which proves that television is a medium for fine arts in the hands of a great director telling the amazing stories of a phenomenal storyteller.
p	Well I received my DVD set and it's ok. But what shocked me is that here they are showing the cover of Reliance Music etc and the seller Pritam Music Pvt Ltd sent me the DVD set produced by Ultra DVD Video !! I didn't return it because it's episodes were ok and quality too. I gave five stars because I love Malgudi Days. My favourite Indian English author is R.K.Narayan.
p	I went back to my childhood days. Thanks for delivering this masterpiece. Shankar Nag's master piece and Swami's innocence takes us back to olden days. Dr.Ramanujam Venugopalan Bangalore
n	Poor product. Not all cd's working properly. Episodes bring back old memories though.
n	I don't know HIndi and I bought this in hurry since I love these stories from my childhood.  I agree it's my mistake overlooking the product page. However it would be much helpful (particularly in country like India) if you could have mentioned the the language in the Heading itself.  Something like  Malgudi Days - HINDI - 18 VCD Premium Pack (1987) Anyways, I gifted it to one of my friend at Noida.
n	DVD-3 IS DEFECTIVE.very bad experince loss of money
n	Some CDs play well, some bad and some very bad.
n	Most of the DVDs did not work
p	Bought it a month ago, almost used every 2nd day, here's the review. Backup and Charging: 1) Charging Time: 8-10hrs, may increase with time with normal wear and tear as with every product. a) Runs for 30-35 Minutes, even more, on a single charge, One charge is basically enough for 10days! 2) Trimming, Styling hardly takes 2-3minutes, So one charge is more than sufficient for your needs, Hence, battery backup should not be an issue, charge once a week, and it will go fine for years. 3) All those saying it isn't corded, It's for your own good, Imagine the risk of getting an electric shock while trimming your beard, You won't want that, Right?? And you will also not run it for whole 35-40 minutes at one go. Maximum 5 minutes is what you'll run it, hence, backup is more then Enough. Performance: 1) Product performs flawless, cuts hairs smoothly, no matter how long your beard has grown. I've been using Philips Shaver too, and even after 3 years, it runs as good a it was for 1st day. Although, used moderately. So blades should not be in doubt. 2) Yes, No Oiling needed. 3) Washable blades, Easily removable and cleanable, However, I didn't find usage of washing it, a blow of air is enough to clean it. 4) Less vibrations and moderate sound. Comfortable for user. Accessories Supplied: Comb: Not the comb you use for your hairs! It fits with the trimmer, and adjust for various lengths, ideal for styling mustache, french cut etc. Quality is good. Handle with care though. Brush: To clean those tiny little hairs on the device. Charger: You can either charge or either use it, No Charging while using it, Light will glow on Charger, but it won't go out, even if it's charged. Few Leaflets, and Yes, Register it on Philips to get an extra year of warranty. The backside of trimmer will have a 4 digit number, above model number, that's your serial number, still having issues? Call Customer Care. Overall Review: product's great! Amazon's price is comparatively cheaper with all, flipkart too, delivery was within 2 days, without any additional delivery scheme asked for. Delivery Guy was very professional, and packaging was rock solid! Go for it, it's more than enough for all your trimming needs.
p	This is a nice trimmer. It has a Good Battery life, but require long time for charging.This gives a precision trimming.
p	Due to its brilliant design, trimming was never so easy before. Light weight, good looks, battery backup is also good and at a very reasonable price. So, guys don't think so much just go for it. I am using it and very satisfied.
p	Perfect Delivery, Original Prdoduct, working good,  extended warranty by registering in philips(to register take a snap on invoice of amazon attached to packed box ), thank you amazon...i have Satisfied
p	For the price, it is the best trimmer available in the market. Very smooth and fast. Near shaving experience .
n	all of a sudden the trimmer stopped working with 10 mins even after charging for whole night and I had do shaving :( Then again I had put for charging and check it didn't work at all..
n	Continuosly it is getting stucked in the middle... Now it is completely stopped working. Where to get it repaired. Please suggest.
n	Pathetic product. The brand has used a lot of clever advertising on TV for this product - bought it, poor plastic casing, bad blades, does not cut fine hair. The adjustment trimmer on top is really bad ... even on setting 3 it cuts very close ... and now the device does not charge. Works only when plugged into the socket else goes off. Overall a very poor experience, pathetic product.
n	Very nice trimmer. Please read below the pros and cons: Pros: Can be used for Haircut, (Clipper over comb) Hair trimming over the ears, nape and back of head for short cuts One can go from long hair to soldier-cut in a few minutes at home, however the battery lasts long enough. Beard trimming is not that great as even at zero (without the plastic guard) beard hair still looks so grown up. Very useful for trimming body hair - chest, underarms and any unwanted hair. Can trim pubic hair, but only if the skin is stretched properly and with guard atleast at 2-3mm. Cons: This product should have had a speed control, as sometimes when it is fully charged, it runs like wool trimmer - very dangerous if care is not taken, it can cut/nick the skin. Always stretch the skin while trimming Size could have been smaller allowing it to be more portable and easy to carry and easy to use. If you trim somewhat grown out beard, then the surroundings like basin and mirror will easily showered with hair which makes a messy cleanup job. The blade is not that safe as it is advertised. If due care is not taken, it can give occasional small cuts in skin very easily
n	very bad !! after 15 days charger not working !!!
p	Using for last 4 months and really comfortable and good looking really stunning.
p	Very good looking and comfortable
p	Comfrt Good looking
p	Excellent one
p	It's small and works really well. Had to use the CD to install the drivers (comes with the device). The signal drops significantly as the distance from router grows. It's good for smaller homes though. Also, it does not catch the signals from my neighbours, which would generally show on my laptops built-in wi-fi mechanism.
p	After using it for a couple of weeks i am giving this feedback. In fact, it is really a good product . I faced no problem connecting with other wifi devices. I am so impressed with the product that i ended up buying two more for my friends! The only issue with this is coverage area. Considering the fact that it's a portable device, one should not expect more.
p	Received the product before time...Happy with the service of Amazon. The device is perfect...No need to purchase an Ethernet Card or any router it does its work as expected both receives the Wi-Fi Signals and transmits the signals from PC connected with a Wired LAN Connection...Only thing is we have to enter the IP address most of the times and some times the signal drops(rarely).
p	I removed the old PCI card and put this USB *dongle* and it did not ask for any drivers but a reboot was enough (I am using Ubuntu). I feel that the sensitivity is a bit less but that can be due to so many other reasons... I like this one because on the older wifi cards, the antenna kept on getting broken. This is far more robust. I gave four stars only because I felt that the sensitivity may be a bit less (compared to *others*). In short, strongly recommended! This one is really plug and forget.
p	i have purchased for my PC which doesn't have wireless network. i have router at my office and main advantage of this product is you don't have to  do anything, just insert the CD and plug and play this. special advantage of this product is that it savings your money who will do wiring from router to PC and its so much hectic like if you have concealed wiring then you cant do anything or if you have wired LAN and you want to change the place of your PC then you cant do that. such a great and compact product
n	The product was not working properly and just did not transmit signals . I gave a negative feedback and was promised my product will be replaced and hence I converted my negative feedback to positive , The behavior changed instantly from VEEDEE enterprises . The lady executive Shashi did not reply to my mails and  despite calling 5 times once i was near their office location just did not bother to tell me the complete address even once !!  which was very troublesome as I kept roaming from one location to the other . The mail address they have put is incomplete . The device did not work there . Disastrously She went to the extent of telling me that I came in to spoil her Saturday - Extremely uncourteous behavior with a customer . However The owner Mr Devesh Tanna  is a Kind gentleman and replaced the dongle instantly. I will certainly never buy anything from veedee if this is the kind of behavior shown once the feedback is changed . would you pay for a Non working device and sit for two months till the product team even bothers to sent an update ? and behave in this way ? No responses No mails once the feedback is changed from Negative to positive A harrowing experience for the first time from Amazon .
n	I would not recommend this product to anybody as this one has many problems. First it does't get recognized by windows7 by itself, you need install its drivers which comes with the CD and the application interface given in this CD is pathetic seems like old Win98 Application. Then comes to connection, this device connects right away when you start it but disconnects after some time and this keeps on happening. This is not because of improper configuration, its due to signal drop from the device. I tried many methods to keep it going but it does't. Rather than going for this I would suggest to go for better brands like Linksys, TPLink, Belkin, NetGear or D-Link which bit more expensive than this. There are some basic models in these brands which are not much expensive which can be used for Home purpose.
n	Its not working at least 30 days
n	While this device connects to internet effortlessly, the connection speed is very slow. You just might have an internet connection for namesake. Forget about streaming videos or even audio for that matter. The transfer speeds were equivalent to a decade back dial up connection. I am not even referring to internet connection where the issue might be with my connection. I have actually measured the data transfer speeds by moving files within network and it moves at dial up connection speeds.
n	Doesn't work properly if router is in another room. Week signal strength and signal quality. May be its suitable for single room setup only. Problem is due to small size and internal antenna.

p	Superb headset with amazing bass:-)
p	i ordered the product on 2 mar and was delivered to me on 4 mar. thanks for the fast delivery amazon. talking about headset, they are just awesome. best product in such a low price. noise reduction is really awesome. i also compared them with a set of apple headset which you get with iphone and also with skulcandy. i am totally satisfied with my choice. Many are talking about that there is no warranty for online purchases of these headsets. yes you dont get warranty for online purchases of jbl products . But i would like to tell you that if you purchase these from FX AUDIO ( i.e.Sahil international) (official dealer for jbl in india) which is a dealer on amazon you get the warranty on showing the bill which you get with the delivery box. I have confirmed these things by calling Sahil international. so go for it !!
p	Here's my honest review on these cool pairs of earphones. Price:- I got it for Rs. 699 which is a great price for a big brand with the brand's signature sound. So I'd say that it's one of the best budget earphones out there. Quality:- The physical quality of the earbuds is great. The wire quality isn't the best but definitely not cheap. Truthfully, I use all my earphones roughly and these earphones survived ;). The wire doesn't tangle very easily but it does tangle. It does get bent easily but it doesn't affect the wire or the sound. Design:- It's a really simple design but they do look beautiful. Sound:- Honestly, these are the best earphones I've ever used and I've used Senheiser CX175, CX180 Street 2 (pretty promising),Skullcandy Riff, Ink'd 2 and Audio Technica C2X5 (expensive ones) and a lot more provided by phone manufacturers The soundstage is perfect. Truthfully, I love bass but I'm not a basshead, I only like bass where it's needed, provided that it's in adequate amount (that is what purebass means :/) AND these earphones DELIVERED. And I don't like it when the bass is overpowering i.e. compromises sound quality, but again, T150A delivered. The treble is good and apparent by which I mean the bass doesn't exercise veto power over it. The lows, mids and highs are all great, thanks to JBL's signature sound. The sound is natural with a punch of bass, what I mean is that it is the whole package, what with a mic and a button for answering/ending calls and playing/pausing music. Comfort:- Really comfortable and snuggly. They fit in the ear perfectly. Delivery:- Amazon was prompt I got these headphones before the estimated delivery date. (2 working days) Believe me I spent weeks searching for the best budget earphones, all pointed towards Senheiser CX180 Street 2 so I took them, but I didn't like them, the sound stage wasn't quite as good, not to mention the absence of a mic and the button also the shape of the plug is well, a bit irritating when the earphones are used. So I went for these and I'm really happy with my choice. I recommend it to anyone who wants earphones and is under a budget. I hope you read the review and buy these. My actual rating is 4.5 (wire quality and I want to act like a critic 😛) but since there is no option for it..........
p	After 50+ hrs of burning. Pros: 1. Awesome sound quality and brilliant bass. Better than what I expected 2. Product looks and feels genuine & sturdy 3. Has a nice mic which work perfectly while making calls. 4. Sheer value for money, I got this headset in Rs. 649 through deal. Couldn't ask for more. Cons: 1. Length of cable is little less, you may find it short if you are a tall person or prefer to keep phone away while listening to music. 2. Cable is sensitive to bruising, it may disturb if you are moving or eating something while listening. 3. Sometimes you may find that bass is getting faded specially if the song in bass boosted. If you are low on budget and looking for a decent headset go for it.
p	First time used JBL headphones. JBL says "Hear the Truth." and they deserve for "Hear the Truth." Here are Pros and Cons Pros : BASS(10/10) : People generally worry about headphone's Bass. But Believe me JBL will not disappoint you. Really POWERFUL BASS and moreover have extremely good quality. Clarity( 9/10 ) Sound Clarity : Sound clarity also depend on your mobile or laptop or other device. But as far as JBL's concern, It gives really good sound clarity to you. Cons : Feels like common headphones. But still JBL wins because of extremely good quality sound. Last words. You will not get Better than this under 800. Go for it blindly.. to "Hear the truth"
n	Well, the product quality is fine. It has good clarity and loudness. But here are a few points worth noting before buying it: 1. The bass response leaves a lot to be desired. I have done all possible tinkering with the equalizers and finally got a passable level. Still, its way below what one can call good bass. 2. The bud-casing is round and small making them difficult to grip while removing or placing on ear. 3. The wires seem a bit flimsy but no issues so far. 4. When using the mic, the noise reduction and clarity of speech is excellent. 5. Product is original with good packaging. 6. The length of the wire is just sufficient for most purposes.
n	pretty average just about worth the 650 rs i paid for it..... whats always good is that having a mic lets u make calls... have to say though that in this price range sound magic is still pretty amazing.. having the jack come out straight is an added disapointment as they dont last that long.... anyway will see how it goes this is my second jbl buy the first was a huge fail a jbl GO blutooth speaker lasted a month!!! the build quality seems pretty cheap its clear tht they are manufacturing this at nothing actual price should be a hundred rs okie should u buy it? well if you dont trust chinese brands like sound magic yes but please dont buy at more than 700 :)
n	I bought this earphones 6 months back.. And from last 2 months I face problems like right side is not working some times or if it works than compare to left side it works slower or voice is starched and it irritates so much . so I contact jbl costemer care in my city Ahmadabad .they say "u have to contact Mumbai branch for solution if u bought it from any local shop than we can slove your problem or u have to deal with it by your self n courier it to Mumbai for replacement . if it is a jbl product y should I have to send it to Mumbai????? Y don't u guys can give replacement in customer care located in my city????
n	I will give u 3/5 Bcoz its a thin wire and get messy. It takes minutes to complete it out with this **cking wire and solve it. It sucks everytime and nobody likes that and 2nd reason is its not that good i mean its build quality is ok ok or less than ok ok. Its not , i m using this stuff from 2 months and its wire is get looser from mic . And coming out from the joint. U dont believe me i apply FAVIQUICK On it, now its fine but now my earphones button is not working its jam bcoz of FAVIQUICK Y I M GIVING 3 STAR FOR THIS BCOZ I GOT THIS IN 599/-RS AND ITS SOUND CLEARITY AND BASE IS GOOD VERY GOOD
n	I have been using this for around 4 months now. Bought it for Rs. 650/- from amazon itself, seemed very good value for money at this price range. These are decent pair for listening music with awesome noise cancellation, bass seems OK not good not bad either. It also has microphone with button to pick up call, I used it regularly and did not faced any issue during calls. Note : I don't think there is any option to disconnects call after you are over with talking, you have wait for other person on other end to disconnect the call. Quality of headphone is good in terms of material used.
p	This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015.  Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device.  This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you. It's broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits.  If you’re in a hurry I’ve included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end. Summary - What can you do with it? ----------------------------------------- * Read a book.  It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday. * Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection * Borrow a book.  Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books  (if you have Amazon Prime Membership) * Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family * Highlight a section.  Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines.  If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated. * Record a bookmark.  To come back to it later * Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position * Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder * Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the “X Ray” feature. * Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks * Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or "family sharing") * Access every book you've ever owned "on the cloud" - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G.. What Devices are available? -------------------------------- As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:- 1. Kindle 6" 2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) 2. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) 3. Kindle Voyger 4. Kindle Fire - 6" or 7" colour tablet computers at around So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options.  Which to buy?  Here's a quick summary in order of cost. *** The entry level Kindle *** An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks. A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender.  For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display.  Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours. *** New Kindle Paperwhite *** Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage.  The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the “original Paperwhite” to 6 weeks - but still a very long time. Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means it’s faster and slicker than before, and a new “Bookerly” font plus better presentation of fonts on screen. If you have an existing Paperwhite it’s probably not worth upgrading.  However, if you own a prior device, you’ll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance. *** The Voyage *** Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter.  It has more of a “quality” feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps direct from getting caught in the edges.  The back has a “soft touch” plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new “Page Press” buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed there’s a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch).  It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge. Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions.  This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesn’t look too bright.  In addition, you’ll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness.  To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device. *** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer *** The "Kindle Fire” range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range.  Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks.  Although you can read books on a “Fire” using the Amazon Kindle App, you’ll find the Kindle with it’s sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book.  You’ll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated “book reader” device. Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep.  The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it won’t for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark. Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while it’s fine for everyday use, it’s less useful on holiday.  The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight. What other options do I have? ---------------------------------- Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:- * Special Offers - ie. adverts * 3G or WIFI connection Personally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle.  They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting. The 3G option is a more difficult question.  This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books “over-the-air” instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot.  Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but it’s a personal choice.  Of course if you won’t have WIFI at home, then you’ll need the 3G option. One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a “Personal Hotspot” or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to.  Got to Settings —> Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while you’re out and about. Conclusion ------------- If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option.  You’ll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but you’ll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite. The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen.  Finally, there’s the top of the range Voyage with the “page press” buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness. If you’re in the market for a “Tablet Computer” then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but you’ll get a better “book reading” experience on the Kindle.  Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2.  I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus. Frequently Asked Questions? --------------------------------- Q:  What file format will a Kindle read? A:  Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion Q:  What?  It doesn’t support EPUB format? A:  No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called “Calibre”.  Simple search for “You Tube um0teoAR6zw” and you’ll see a video explaining how to do this.  Simples. Q:  If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as well? A:  No.  All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device. Q:  Can I save my place in the book? A:  Yes.  It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position. Q:  I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font size? A:  Yes.  There’s a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastes Q:  Can I share books with my partner or children? A:  Yes.  You can now share your books using "Amazon Family Library" to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family Q. Can I use a Kindle to read in bed? A. Yes.  But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models.  It’s a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light.  For the base Kindle model you’ll need the light on Q. Are there any free books available? A. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded.  If you have a “Amazon Prime” membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books. Q:  How long does the battery last? A:  Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day.  I’ve certainly found I’ve gone for weeks without charging the device Q:  How long does it take to charge? A:  From absolutely flat, around 4 hours Q:  How many books will the Kindle hold? A:  Literally thousands.  You can also download every book you’ve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited. Q:  Do I need anything else? A:  You’ll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesn’t come with a charger (but the Fire does).  Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it.  Some people also buy a “cover”, but I think this is not really needed.  It adds to the weight, and is not really needed.  It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if it’s left knocking around in a bag.
p	I pre-booked the Kindle on 28th. It was shipped on 29th and it arrived on July 1st. This is the Second e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought.I have loved and used my Kindle Touch for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark.Then came the original Paperwhite, with its small size, sharper screen and front-lighting. The 2015 Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the 2015 Paperwhite. If you have the original Kindle, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the 2015 Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 Paperwhite. I purchased a Kindle Touch and I also use a Nexus 7 Tablet but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this 2015 model was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new Kindle. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text. 2015 Paperwhite Vs, Kindle Voyage The Voyage gives you improved contrast, quasi-button zones for turning pages, an adaptive backlight, and 12 percent less weight than other Kindles, but I don’t really think those things add up to being worth the extra cost. While the Kindle Voyage remains Amazon's high-end ebook reader, you simply can't beat the Paperwhite for sheer value. The Paperwhite is a fantastic value for the price. Pros Affordable, priced same as old Paper-white and 5,000 INR less than Kindle Voyage.. Sharp, bright screen. Improved performance. Excellent interface. Cloud-based storage. Vast ebook store. Cons No adaptive back-light, waterproofing, or audiobook support. Bottom Line Thanks to a sharper display, faster performance, and the same affordable price, Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhite is the best ebook reader you can buy.
p	It took me months to decide whether i should buy a gadget for 11000 to read books. Took the decision exactly during the launch of this new kindle. And i am extremely happy with this decision. Its been two days. So cant comment about the battery life. Feel and look are great. Compared it with an actual paperback. I was worried before about the rendering of pdfs when i read the reviews of prev gen kindle. Thanks to Calibre i could easily convert the pdfs into kindle format and it is perfect. The only con is the flicker when we turn the page. Just a small con. POOR Packaging: Reduced one star for packaging. Product was delivered by Aramex logistics. It was just covered by a simple cardboard just like a book cover. Not even a single layer of Bubble wrap for this 11,000 Gadget?? why?? UPDATE :After using it for more than 4 months, Battery Backup: Battery backup is good. Most of the times i keep the screen on for 1 or 2 hrs, though i don't read the book continuously. For such use, battery backup is one month approximately. i.e i have charged my kindle only 4 or 5 times. Eye strain: No eye strain while reading it in day time. But a very slight(negligible) strain can be experienced when reading in night time. That strain is not much. Not like the smartphone screen. But since it is after all a digital screen, you will feel that. BEST PRO : Reading time has increased. Mobile usage has decreased.
p	I am sitting on a train at New Delhi and a foreigner dressed as a Sadhu is going around and offers spiritual books to read. I politely turn him down and return to reading from my Kindle. He then goes on to berate the stupidity of reading on electronic devices and predicts that pretty soon we would even get food from a computer screen. I smile at him again and return to my book. The Kindle is a smart little device that does one thing, and one thing well. But do you need it?? Well here are some Pros: 1. It is light. Crazy light when you consider it can hold thousands of books. 2. I am interested in philosophical books, historical treatises and old books in general and you can find books by Dante, Aristotle, Einstein, Shakespeare for free online!! Talk about a free lunch!! 3. It is distraction free 4. It will be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. For ye non LOTR people, it has incredible battery life. 5. You can buy, review, recommend, browse books from this one device, provided you have a Wifi or 3G connection 6. I have always lamented switching on a light for reading, cause it seems like a waste of electricity considering how long i read and most of the time the lighting is not ideal, but with the Paperwhite all I need is a comfortable corner to sit in and I am set for the rest of the year. 7. It is so convenient when you want to quickly pick up a book and start reading. I carry my Kindle like most people carry their iPads and I set to reading when I feel like I will have to wait for a long while (which is a lot in India)!! 8. You can get the newspaper or magazines directly to your Kindle for free (ahem ahem) if you use Calibre. However I gave up on this as I had an error once too often. 9. Get a case, you will love the personality it can add. I personally got the Amazon Genuine Leather case from the US and it is awesome. You cant get that case here though. But the case just protects the screen and overall device at all times. My Kindle fell from the top berth in a train while I slept. I woke up in the middle of the night and found it on the floor on top of some shoes. So while it didnt suffer much impact I am sure the screen would have been scratched had I not had the case on. Cons: 1. It is just not a real book. I still prefer the feel and smell of a physical book. This doesnt even come close but I have never found reading this easy. Now I always have a book close by and can read under any light. I like physical books but right now I have no idea when I will be required to shift to a new city or will have to travel but now I dont need a carton of books each time I travel. So is it for everyone? No!! If you want to read like crazy, if you prefer reading to the TV show playing next door, if you can zone out and read in public, if you need your literary fix so much so that people suggest you go to rehab, this device is for you. For everyone else, its your money and your choice.
p	If you travel a lot and want to spend your this time in reading, then it is a recommended device otherwise books are always better when you are at home. You have to convert PDF files into kindle format before reading it on kindle. PDF versions are not as good as kindle version. Some pictures will be lost in this process of conversion from PDF to kindle format. Please be aware that there is no service centre, meaning your device won't be repaired if you break it accidentally even in warranty period.
n	I paid Rs.14000 for kindle paperwhite with 3G+wifi. It's exactly 18 months and the screen has frozen. Support says they can't help. So Rs.14000 down the drain in only one and a half years. What is amazing is that there is no service center in India ! How can a company sell such a costly product and have no service center? As long as it worked, the product was wonderful. But having to throw away a Rs.14000 product after only 18 months is very painful. The customer service executive has given me a gift voucher of Rs.1000 as a consolation, perhaps? So, a great product (as long as it works) but horrible service.
n	On the first day of my purchase i found there were darkness at the bottom of the screen where led's are placed. The light or the color of the screen when full bright was not uniform.
n	Very bad experience with this model of kindle. The same has been replaced three times and all three devices have some defects. Most common distraction point were two pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen. So if i differentiate defects by devices that has been replaced by amazon they goes like this: Device 1: Two pitch black spots at the bottom of the  screen. Device 2: Three pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen + Pale Yellowish dull display. Device 3: Two pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen + Light leakage at two points on both the sides of the display. So in a nutshell not at all a good experience while reading on this product, the previous generation has no such glitches and i would rather advice to go for previous generation model or wait for a while and not to go for the June, 2015 batch of the same product has to my experience that batch is having some serious manufacturing  defects. Apart from the product, i do really appreciate the customer service and refund/replacement policies of amazon.
n	This is the first e-reader i have ever owned and earlier to this i relied on dead trees for my reading,  so I had no idea what to expect from a kindle. Now i have been using the New kindle paperwhite since a month and it's been a positive experience (mostly). First the hardware: Kindle has an excellent e-ink display at a resolution of 1440*1080p backed with an excellent built in light allowing you to read under almost any front size and light conditions. This solves my first major problem while reading an actual book(can't read it with lights off). The build quality is very good, with the power button and charging port at the bottom. But i feel that the power button would be better on top or back(like voyager) instead of bottom because it might be uncomfortable for some while reading in Landscape mode. The battery backup was good, it lasted long enough to read 2 books (about 6000 loc each) but it might vary according to your reading speed and brightness settings. Now the Software (where problem starts): It has 2  built in English dictionary and many more from other languages on cloud to download if required. Dictionary and the word wise (later is only for books bought on amazon)are 2 features which brings smart reading experience to kindle. But as mentioned my experience with software was not very pleasant and in no particular order here are some problems i came across. 1) Landscape mode is restricted to only one side, which would not be a problem if bezels on top and bottom were symmetrical, but they aren't,  hence causing a problem mostly for right handed people. 2) Drm free books can only be read from documents folder from storage (it took me 20 mins to figure out the problem). 3)Amazon pulling the plug on active content and games support from this generation of kindles. 4)No support for epub 5)Cannot take written notes or create simple text documents, which comes in very handy. 6)Browser doesn't not have multiple tabs. 7)horrible scaling for pdf(seriously don't buy kindle as a device for reading pdf,  it sucks). 8)Amazon won't allow you to share your book for more than once, and that too only for 14 days (which is total bs btw). and many more so on. So amazon if you are reading this plz look in to the problems. Finally the conclusion: For me though the feel of reading actual book is still superior to a kindle, but smart reading experience provided by kindle with features like dictionary x-ray and word wise along with in buit light makes me never go back to read a normal book. And since majority of my problem with kindle are software related (i think so) and can be fixed with an update (if amazon are willing to fix them). I can and will strongly recommend kindle to anybody who wants a smarter and good reading experience with very little comprises. PS: The packaging seemed good from outside but shocked to see that there was NO BUBBLE WRAP or anything else (just a cardboard wrapped around the actual box). It costs 11000 and you can't even ensure proper packing, did not expect this from cloudtail. PPS: Removed 2 stars because i had to replace my kindle due to black spots at the bottom of screen and the screen looks pale yellowish on the new one(look out for defective ones).
n	While the kindle itself is a good e reader, there appears to be a complete lack of quality control on these devices. Im currently on my 4th kindle. The first had a non functional touch screen, which was promptly replaced. The second had a terrible uneven backlight with atleast 20% of the screen darker than the rest. The third had what appeared to be specks of dust trapped within the display which glowed extremely bright whenever the backlight was turned on. The kindle that i currently use still does not have a completely even screen, however with the backlight turned down, its slightly less noticeable. I am however not going to return this one, as it would appear that receiving a kindle without issues is next to impossible, and i would run the risk of receiving one that has even worse screen issues. Unlike a television where screen issues are typically obscured by the movement of images on the screen,on an e-reader, where one would spend hours looking at what amounts to fairly static images/pages, these flaws are even more glaring. Honestly, i would have expected far more from amazon, and am appalled by the poor quality of the overall product, especially when one takes into account that this is by no means cheap. Kudos however to amazon customer care, who have been courteous, and willing to deal with multiple returns/replacements.
p	1.Well the delay in writing this reviw is coz i wanted to test it an see the product.also i wanted to write the feed back using the laser keyboard itself. 2.  The keyboard is a chinese  product no doubt but it works like majic indeed. The sensitivity is is pretty good and one gets the feel of a normal key board. Also it has the multi function keys;which is to say that if u press shift key and type the letters then the capital letters get printed.thus the device is actually detecting multiple keys at the same time. 3.  A feature shown in one of the videos was that the device can also be used as a mouse pointer and to scroll pages but this did not work in case of zook. I paired it with two  of my phones one by one and it worked well. 4.  The restriction is that the device needs a plane hard surface to project and detect the images. U cant just spread a hanky and start typing on ur glass table.this is a little restricting.although it wud have been the best if the keyboard coud be projected on any surface whatsoever(ie even curved and serrated such as a bed sheet) and be able to type. 5.  The battery backup in one flow is a thing i am yet to check on but i guess it shud be pretty neat for the sock and awe type of occassions where this device intially will be most used. 6.  Do keep ur user manual safe coz i lost mine and now i dont knw how to swith of the beep feedback in device and save battery.since the device is very new no online manual or videos on youtube exist to assist u. Enjoy ur devices.its a great buy.
p	kindly advise how to use the mouse key on laptop!
p	Its nice but the price is way to high. Not that comfortable to use yet. I'll suggest to wait for sometime till the advamced model is launched and definitely the price go down.
p	Excellent
p	Best keyboard i hv used....
n	The actual product is quite different from what was seen in the pic.  Quality of the keyboard projection and blue tooth connectivity was poor.  I had to eventually return the product.
p	Superb n software also work but only red color no other color work
p	EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND DELIVERY
p	Very Good
n	I'm unable to edit/customize as it says. The font and letters look blurred no matter what different ways you try to customize. The ones which already comes in the usb Looks good and clear. Pretty disappointed.
n	The product is amazing. Worked for the first two days. After I custom made the messages, it stopped showing messages. Will show only the 1st message. Then resets to the beginning of the 1st msg. Doesnt show the other msgs.
n	Cannot edit text . Even after editing three lines appear . Not worth it if you are wanting to edit and display some text .
n	So bad not used even once such a hopeless product. Such a fraud product. No light. In it just fan
n	I m getting an error while downloading profram. Failed to write a data . Pls help
p	nice led in this range picture quality is great but some problem facing of connectivity with USB port wall mount not delivered with this product guys installation and setup is very easy so don't waste your 2000 rs to 3000 rs on LG guy for installation and wall mount. for wall mount u can purchase separately from amazon in 450 rs and spend 100 rs on local guy for wall mounting my 10th class brother had installed this easily .
p	It's a great TV, though a few things must be kept in mind: 1) Apparently, buying the same TV offline will give you a 2 year warranty instead of one, and installation, demo, and the bracket (which cost me ~1300) will be free. 2)The TV does NOT have 3 USB and 3 HDMI ports. It actually has 1 USB and 2 HDMI ports. Apart from this, great TV. Plays movies off USB flawlessly. Remote feels a bit cheap in the hand, though.
p	Purchased this TV on Oct 2015. Working fine so far. Worth for the money. Pros:(rating out of 5) Bigger size - 4 Picture quality - 3 Sound quality - 3 Connectivity - 3 Warranty & support - 2 Cons: Limited connectivity - Doesn't have port to connect 5.1 output For advanced users, WiFi not available and hence they need to go for a coslty one Sound quality could have been improved. 10W speakers couldn't provide that much intensity in audio. You need to go to 30-40 pts to hear the audio properly in large hall. They missed the wall mount bracket. I asked for compensation and Amazon agreed to pay the price of the Bracket bought offline from a store.
p	Excellent TV .purchased from snap deal for offer price. Go for it. With out second thoughts. 43 inch. Very big TV. Awesome clarity. Try playing HD high bit rate videos. Its like theater. Picture quality is awesome. Audio good. U can get 100% picture quality unless you have HD set of box with HD connection. And HD videos. Pictures quality is too good. Very good beautifully designed TV. Excellent TV. Go for it.
p	This is the first time I ordered a TV online the delivery was very prompt hats off to Amazon About the TV it looks very elegant in my living room. It is a basic TV with no frills completely worth the price I paid which was 36k and the pic quality is soothing
n	Dont buy LG tv. my TV display is not working. raised complaint with LG support. still now issue is not resolved. utter waste suport form LG. so pleasse dont buy LG tv. my complaint no:- RNA151231087190 utter waste service. totally frustrated with LG support.
n	Disappointed by the price which is offered by AMAZON, they have removed the bracket and installation , i had to pay Rs .5300/- extra for the flexi bracket and installation. The TV packagin clearly shows that a FLEXI bracket is included inspite of that i had to  pay extra. AMZON is taking us fo ra ride by quoting a low price.
n	I have already confirm with LG on call about bracket in the order but still it does not include Flexi Wall Mount Bracket when delivered. Now i have to buy it. Very disappointing
n	Probleam with demo and installation..
n	Hi folks. I have purchased this TV a couple of days ago. Yet to be delivered. I have purchased from a local showroom for 39.5k. Both table and wall mount supplied free of charge. I. Think it requires a stabilizer. Which is a must for a country like India. Will play around with it for a while and provide my opinion shortly.
p	Gameplay may not be as good as pes 16, but still can't stop playing this game...maybe It's because of premier League, which is missing in pes (I know we can edit the kits)..only annoying thing about this game is that cpu just tries to play "chelsea "  all the time... Passing around the back even if they are a goal down in 30mins.  Doesn't make sense, but FUT is fun to play as always...
p	I purchased fifa 16 and it was in bad state on its release.  It's shoots are not good,  goalkeeper always blocks the shot,  online connectivity problems, etc. But it's update made this game a new Fifa 16 then what was at its launch. So those thinking to buy,  get it now and update before playing. Review - 7.6 (At launch) - 8.8( after updates)
p	I placed an order for one day delivery as needed this game urgently to gift to someone. All is well that ends well, got the product on time, absolutely in its best shape, no hampering done to it and the person i got it for jumped with joy and i had a smile on my face.
p	Graphics are stunning. The crowd looks pretty realistic. Dribbling is smooth. The only problem is the passing and player switch. Few glitches. But the enhanced atmosphere and the official bundesliga license makes it an awesome game. The players look stunning with detailed tattoo. Messi's right hand tattoo looks stunning. Overall a must buy game!
p	Amazon happy with your delivery. ...products was really well packed  took some time to open it....☺ . The game is really awesome .this series keeps surprising  me year after year  the game presentation the crowd chant  , players emotions are so freaking  real .....it's a must buy for soccer lovers  thumps up to fifa 16👍👍
n	Don't buy this if you have brought FIFA 15, nothing much has changed. The announcers still say the same thing, the graphics have not been improved much, the bugs from the previous games are still there, I would recommend to those that don't FIFA previously to just buy FIFA 15, as FIFA 15 and FIFA 16 are almost the same. Plus in FIFA 16 the defenders are usually as fast as a striker
n	Available for just 1599 on playstation network. Don't know why amazon not providing similar discounts, just because of the price difference i have to buy from psn. Game quality is fine.
n	Not as great, lot of problems with online gameplay, sometimes you do not find any players online, its ridiculuous, I play all other games online, no such problems.
n	the quality of FIFA is going down every year.Buying PES would be an absolute no-brainer if Konami get the licenses
n	Okay so I didn't purchase the game from Amazon as it takes 3-4 days for them to deliver it here and I preordered it from the Xbox store so that I could play it exactly on the release date... Now about the game... I'm a big big FIFA fan and have bought each and every FIFA  game since FIFA 10. FIFA 16 has some minor changes as compared to FIFA 15 so I thought that after buying every FIFA game for the past 6 years...I won't buy it this year but I got tempted and bought it... There's not much change in the graphics but the game is very defensive.I play on world class and mainly play career mode. No longer I can score 4-5 goals in a game.The opponents defending has got a major boost.Also in FIFA 15/14 if you're plying with Ronaldo or Messi or any player with high dribbling attribute,you could take the ball from defence to attack single handedly without any problem but you can't do that in FIFA 16.You have to have teamwork and passing.The no touch dribbling is good but difficult to perform as most of the times you get tackled and the trick fails. The career mode changes are just ok ok, a pre season tournament and player training,but after all this years there should more changes in the career mode.Also there are some good in game stats like which team is the best defensively(the team with the lowest goals consided) etc. The new addition is the women's team which are good but limited...hope EA sports add more female teams. So,should we buy FIFA 16? If you're a die hard FIFA fan like me or a FIFA fan boy,just grab your copy. If you liked FIFA 15's attacking play then stick to it or buy PES 2016. Although I haven't played PES but this years PES reviews are really really good. Verdict:EA Sports really need to bring a drastic change in the game...only changes in FUT is not enough ..this year they'll face a tough competition against PES 2016. My rating-7/10 Add me on Xbox live GT:Springchaff86
p	Good product. It says light as much as 11w CFL, I feel it is even brighter. Very prompt service as well.
p	Provides enough illumination to cover a small room or bathroom. I'm happy with it
p	Excellent product , value for money,  very bright light and quality body of the bulb compared  to other leading brand i am using. I can say Phillips is ahead than any other led brand in terms of quality and lumen
p	philips product is expensive but as compare  to other  brand it value for money. quality and satisfaction comes with philips product
p	Product is very good, delivery much better got just 3days
n	Its really wrost product... its flickering always... never expected from phillips and Amazon.....
n	Worst product from Philips, it's illumination is good, but it is flickering ( i. e..... Bulb lighting goes up and down automatically even at good & stable voltage conditions. I had never expected such a thing from Philips
n	Good bulb but flickers and since I got it 11 days ago I can't return it. Lets hope the warranty does some good.
n	Both the Bulbs keeps on flickering. Returned on the same day. Not expected from Philips and Amazon
n	Good
p	I just love the Apple Pencil. Amazing product.
p	100% original product apple pencil and it work with my ipad pro perfect
p	Excellent product recd in specified promised time.
p	Amazing and 100% genuine ❤️
n	It should have come included with the iPad pro. Way too expensive which adds to the already high price of the iPad pro. The battery life is also not too impressive lasting a day (for comparison, the surface pen which comes included with the surface pro 4 lasts about year before running out of battery). Also, I have found the charging method of the pencil a but awkward and risky. It plugs into to port of the iPad for recharging, which means you can't use the port while the pencil is charging and you might damage the pencil or your iPad port while using the iPad at the time if by accident your hand or something hits the pencil plugged into the iPad.
p	BEAUTY WITH BRAINS! Update: The SD card issue has been solved in the latest software patch with oxygen OS 2.1.3 INTRODUCTION One Plus, a Chinese smart phone start up, made waves last year, when they launched the much lauded One Plus One. Packed with flagship level internals, and an unbelievable price tag, One Plus One soon became the heartthrob of the smart phone market. Earlier this year, One Plus announced its successor, the One Plus Two. However, the phone could not live up to the hype generated by its predecessor, and the continuance of the invite-only system made prospective buyers look elsewhere. And now, One Plus has launched their first mid-range smart phone, in an attempt to reclaim its lost glory. Will it? UNBOXING Unboxing the One Plus X, I couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the packaging and their attention to detail. You get a charger, a high quality flat-wired micro-USB cable along with the usual literature, and of course the One Plus X itself. One Plus has also included a translucent back cover, but some part of it seemed to stick to the phone and it looked ugly. I am unsure whether this happened with others. Anyways, One Plus has also included a factory-fitted clear- screen guard. But, be careful while peeling off the protective film, as you may remove the screen guard along with it. DESIGN AND BUILD  QUALITY On paper, one plus seems to be a rejigged One Plus One, with the same internals  and price bracket. But one look at the phone and you will know the difference. With glass to the front and back and metal to the sides, this phone looks and feels gorgeous.  The device sports a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 covered  5” AMOLED display, flanked by the earpiece sensors, 8 MP front camera and a notification LED at the top and  the reversible capacitive keys at the bottom. The back has a shiny, glossy, inky-black scratch resistant glass with the One Plus logo and a 13MP camera and LED flash, flush to the back. The edges are metal clad, with 17 high precision microcuts, which gives the phone a good grip. The sim tray (housing a hybrid dual SIM/ microSD card slot), volume rockers and the power button are to the right, while we see the alert slider from the One Plus Two on the left. The top has a 3.5 mm audio jack and the secondary noise cancellation microphone, while the single firing speaker, the micro USB port (not USB type-c) and the primary microphone are at the bottom. The dual speaker grille, out of which only one fires, gives the phone a beautiful symmetry and shows the attention to detail. The front and back panel has 2.5D curved glass that hides the bezels and gives the phone a premium, elegant look.  At about 6.9 mm thick and under 140g, the phone is extremely compact and single handed usage is a breeze. Yes, the glass is a finger print magnet and is slippery, but that is to be expected.  These minor gripes aside, the One Plus X is the best looking phone I have ever seen. It has its inspirations, but it still manages to stand out on its own. DISPLAY As mentioned above, One Plus has gone with an AMOLED panel in the One Plus X, and hence it has punchier colours, deep blacks and excellent viewing angles. The screen has a resolution of 1980x1080 with a pixel density of 441ppi. The display is bright and sharp with no pixilation. An AMOLED display also means One Plus X can make use of features like ambient display (screen lights up when you get a notification) and proximity wake (waving your hand over the sensors will bring up the time and notifications) without eating up the battery life, since only individual pixels needs to turned on, unlike an LCD display. One Plus also has a dark mode enabled by default, which further helps in the battery longevity, while differentiating the phone from other vanilla android counterparts. However the auto brightness was a bit too unreliable and I had to turn it off. I hope a software patch will fix this. And I hope one plus implement a colour calibration option, so that people wanting accurate colour temperatures can tone down the saturation. Also, the whites have a slight bluish tint at certain angles. It is invisible if you won’t look for it, but I thought it was worth mentioning. PERFORMANCE The phone, though a mid-ranger, does not come with mid-range internals. Instead of going for a Snapdragon 615 or a 617, One Plus has packed this phone with last year’s Snapdragon 801 chipset. This means, the phone has  four Krait 400 cores, clocked at 2.3 GHz each, and an Adreno 330 GPU (clocked at 578 MHz). It has 3 GB of RAM an 16 GB of onboard storage, out of which about 11 GB is free on the first boot (the storage is expandable).  Note that, contrary to reports, this is not the Snapdragon 801 used in the One Plus One. That was an overclocked CPU, namely, the MSM8974AC. The one used in the One Plus X is the MSM8974AB. This doesn’t mean much to the normal user, for whom, the performance will be a breeze. Apps open quickly, there is minimal lag and the huge RAM means multitasking is never a problem. Even gaming was a pleasant experience, with even high-end games like Modern Combat 5 played fine. Only Asphalt 8 displayed slight choppiness, but that may be a software issue due to lack of optimisation, which will, most likely, be fixed.  In fact only if you compare it with the current gen flagships, would you notice any difference, which is excellent for a mid-ranger. There s slight heating in the back panel, when the device is put to intensive usage, but it does not get over the 45 Celsius mark Many would lament the absence of a 64 bit processing unit, but honestly, for that technology to become the norm, it would take at least a few more years, and until then it is just a spec to gloat about. HARDWARE The One Plus X continues the dual sim functionality introduced in the one plus 2, but this time, it is a hybrid slot! Yes, one plus finally has a device which supports microSD upto 128 GB, that is, if you omit the dual sim functionality. There are two nano sim slots, with the second one doubling up as a microSD card slot. Both sim slots support 4G LTE, but only one can be activated at a time, while the other will run on 2G. The alert slider is also a useful feature, and has been revamped for a more pronounced texture and better feedback. There are three options; slide from the bottom, once for priority notifications and twice for no notification while the option at the bottom enables all notifications. The volume output from the bottom-firing speaker is pretty loud and clear, though a wee bit tinny. An inbuilt equalizer could solve the problem by bumping up the bass. However the volume output from the headphone jack was excellent. I tested it with the Xiaomi Pistion 3 and the Audio Technica ATH M20-x and I was impressed. The vocals are great, there is no breaking and the bass is adequate. The call quality via the microphone and the signal reception too were excellent, though I must say I had a couple of call drops. This might be a carrier issue, but I am not sure. A lot of hardware features present in the One Plus One and one plus two have been omitted. There is no NFC, so Android Pay is off.  The fingerprint scanner is also omitted, probably to cut costs. Along with these, there are also some unnecessary omissions which One Plus seems to have made. For one, the capacitive keys aren’t backlit. And more importantly, the more powerful  5 GHz WiFi band is missing.  For US buyers, a major issue might be the lack of LTE, with bands 12 and 17 not supported. This means both T Mobile and AT&T; customers will be stuck on the HSPA networks (3G). However, most international customers have no such issues and in India, Airtel’s 1800MHz and 2300MHz bands are fully supported. There is also no wireless charging or quick charging, and the USB-C type found in the One Plus Two has been replaced by the older micro USB port. BATTERY The One Plus X packs in 2525 mAh battery, and the battery life is above average. On a moderate day of usage, you will be able to last a full day with about 3.5-4 hours of screen-on-time. However, with a day of heavy usage, you might last only about 9 hours with 5 hours screen-on-time. On a looping video playback test in half brightness and full volume (in MX Player), the phone drained from 100% to 0% in about 8 hours. Though wireless charging and fast charging aren’t supported, it doesn’t make a huge difference, as the small 2525 mAh battery charges up reasonably fast with the included accessories SOFTWARE The One Plus X runs on Android 5.1.1, lollipop. However, after the bitter breakup with Cyanogen, One Plus X runs on its own custom android skin Oxygen OS 2.1.2. However, unlike other manufacturer overlays, one plus has a bloat free, almost vanilla interface with some nifty features added for customisation. First, there is the dark mode, which inverts the stock android look. There are features like App permissions (permissions manager on a per-app level), notifications manager (micro-manage app notifications) and quick settings management (choose which quick settings to be displayed in the notification toggle). The Shelf feature from the One Plus Two makes a return. Shelf is a feature which displays your widgets, recent apps and contacts in the leftmost home screen. It is harmless and useful at times, and at worst, it can be turned off. The gesture support from the previous one plus iterations, including double tap to wake, drawing an O or a V to open the camera and turn on the flash light from the lock screen respectively are also present and accounted for. Minor customisations like the ability to change the LED notification and the accent colour gives the user to make minor cosmetic yet unobtrusive changes to the UI. The ability to turn on screen navigation overlay and swap buttons are highly appreciated, especially since the capacitive buttons aren’t backlit. A huge bug in the UI is in the microSD detection. While the file manager shows the card, and you can use it for multimedia storage, it doesn’t show up in the storage options, thereby not allowing apps to be moved to the SD card. The good news is, One Plus is aware of the issue and an OTA update is promised. All in all, Oxygen OS is a great Android UI, one of the few which gives valuable customisation options without tinkering with Google’s version of an Android experience. It is also quite stable with no app crashes or slow downs. At worst, the added features can be ignored and you can enjoy a stock android experience. Add to that, One Plus has an excellent software team working round the clock, solving bugs, making performance improvements and adding features. The Marshmallow update is also promised in the next year Q1, so software wise, you are covered. CAMERA The One Plus X comes packed with 13 MP (4:3 aspect ratio) rear camera with LED flash, while there is an 8MP fixed focus front facing camera for selfie lovers. The primary camera, contrary to reports is not the same one used in either of the two previous One Plus smart phones. One Plus, this time went with a Samsung ISOCELL sensor with an f2.2 aperture and phase detection autofocus. This is the same sensor used in the Samsung Galaxy S5, but the similarity ends there. The photos are average at best, with unreliable exposure compensation and colour accuracy. Sometimes, the photos come out pretty good, while other times, it’s pretty disappointing. However, there is minimal shutter lag, the dynamic range is good and the saturation levels give punchier photos. The detailing and sharpness are also pretty good, as long as you don’t zoom in. All this is however in outdoor shots, with high noise levels creeping in, in low light and artificial lighting conditions. Move in to video, and it gets terrible. The video maxes out at 1080p, and that too is very bad. It is shaky, loses focus quickly and has a lot of ghost effects. The front facing camera, on the other hand is excellent. With a wide angle lens and an f2.4 aperture, even artificial lighting produces great results.  The beauty mode also helps without going overboard. The video quality of the front camera is also pretty good for Skype calls, and it also shoots at 1080p. The camera app is bare bones, and offers basic features like a timer, panorama, slow motion and time lapse. Swipe up or down in the viewfinder for modes, and oddly, in the panorama mode, the orientation shifts to portrait mode, which is annoying. The photo mode also has clear image and HDR. While clear image is pretty good (it takes 10 shots of the same image to create the perfect shot, in theory), HDR just cranks up the exposure, without doing anything about the blown up highlights. And both take a couple seconds extra, though that is acceptable. The ring along with the focus tap, to adjust exposure is a welcome feature, though it is not as perfected as the one, say, in MIUI. Overall, the camera is the phone’s weakest link, though it has to do more with software than hardware. I am sure, the camera interface and the quality will improve in coming times. And, don’t get me wrong, this camera is perfect for social media and instagramming, it’s just not for photography geeks. MY TAKE Overall, despite its flaws and trade-offs, One Plus X is a solid phone. And at a price of Rs 16999 or $249, it is the best smart phone money can buy! That is – if you can get your hands on an invite. This time, however, invites are available in plenty, and more often than not, you can grab an invite with a little effort. Moreover, the phone will go on open sale within a month, so that should please a lot of people. In my opinion, no phone is perfect. And everything comes at a price. For me, I need great looks, a great performance, and decent battery life. Issues like lack of NFC, a 64bit processor, 5GHz WiFi band, a finger print scanner and fast charging doesn’t matter to me, for I don’t use any of these. And I like a minimalistic and aesthetic design, so I like One Plus X more than the One Plus One too. So, in my humble, personal opinion, I love the OPX. I think it is a great phone. Some of cons do not affect me, others I trust the company to fix soon. But,I diligently, mentioned all the pros and cons of the device, to the best of my abilities, now the choice is yours. My opinion – GO FOR IT! PS: there is a limited edition ceramic variant also available in Europe and India for a higher price of Rs.22999. It is entirely the same as the variant reviewed here (Onyx), other than the built (fire-baked ceramic). This is my first review, so if you liked it, I would appreciate an upvote.

p	Hi All, Thanks all for those who made my review as helpful one... On this days I  faced few issues thought to share it with solutions.... Feel free to share your thoughts.. 1) Vibrates while on call: Its not for everyone I have checked on few forums some of them facing this issue.. I do have this issue.. They said its because of some bug on "double tap to wake option".. pls disable it in the gesture settings.. I tried this yesterday for a day it worked.. 2) Not able to get into Apps Menu: I faced this issue on last week friday.. I'm able to unlock the screen and I can access homepage and frequently used apps by right swiping.. BUT not able to get into the Apps menu/Main Menu list from home page.. it automatically comes out to home page if I try for Apps Menu list.. I spoke with Oneplus Customer care.. they asked to do factory reset.. I did :( ..  then only I got to know some solutions in the forums that by enabling google search bar in the home page menu that pblm will be solved.. I faced this issue again and I tried it.. It Worked... Other than this its working well for me.. As I have mentioned this is my first review anything abt the mobile which I bought recently.. Oneplus X.. If u feel anything wrong in my comment.. pls share it.. Before getting to the CONS and PROS.. I would like to mention few things before you buy Oneplus X.. 1. I have seen few complaints that they are not able to download apps from playstore.. I too faced the issue initially.. I tried few steps and I'm able to download the apps now.. First clear the cache in Google Play Services and also the Clear All Data for the same and deleted the google account and restart the phone and add google account 2. Second thing about memory card not supporting issue.. its support memory card but on the initial stage it will not show on the storage settings after the second update from oneplus it will show you the SD card option. 3. About Camera Manual Mode - On the recent update (2.2.0) they have updated manual mode also u can move apps to SD card (even camera application to SD card) 4. They have battery saver mode option.. so it helps on battery draining.. U can set when the battery saver has to turn on.. 5. Also here you can use the network selections like 4G, 3G or 2G.. so u have an option to reduce the internet usage (I believe this will known to everyone) Now coming to PROS and CONS PROS 1. It has good design.. As so many of them mentioned its looks like upgraded version and combined of iPhone 4S and Sony Xperia designs.. It really nice.. As per my point of view.. 2. Its display quality is AWESOME.. I tried playing Asphalt 8.. its graphics view are really great!!! 3. About Performance its working very well.. No lags as of now.. I've been using it for past 6 days.. 4. Many of them said its camera is not good.. But as per my view on the daylight it gives very good quality of images... really its nice.. We have to know how to use it.. there r few options u can choose it like HDR, Beauty, Clear Images, etc.. As I mentioned now they update manual mode as well.. so its working well.. CONS 1.As most of you heard it has some heating issues.. But its not over heating.. On recent days every mobile gets heating because of higher performance and usage.. This heating issue also I faced only on Playing Games.. Again I'm saying its acceptable as its common with this days.. 2. Battery - Yeah its draining little faster while playing games.. It suddenly reduced from 100% to 99 after few minutes of charged.. As of now I'm getting upto 1 day with regular usage of calls,whatsapp, gaming and videos.. 3. Camera - On very low light it has noise/not clear image as compared to Daylight Images.. But with good light condition it has good quality.. About Flash its works well for portrait and inside room condition.. If I made bad writeup.. dont take it serious :)
p	This is what you all want under 17000/- INR.  Let's start with its display Must say it's better than previous One plus  devices as I have One plus 2.  Well Oneplus X has amoled display of 441ppi.  Colors are more deep and sharp. About body What a fabulous design.  Inherited from Apple iPhone 4S and some of their own like alert slider and slim Ness.  Must say it's beauty.  Metal frame from side and back panel made of glass makes you feel richer. Camera Front Camera is good but little disappointed with rear.  Auto focus wasn't that much better and pics wasn't that much good maybe a software bug. So it will be resolved. Well Now performance 3GB of ram with 2.3Ghz clocked makes sense but perhaps when you get the hands on this phone you won't feel like to play games in this beauty.  These hardware will later allow you to customize your device like rooting and take it to next level.  You can play games in this but the dimension and thinness of this device won't let you play for long.  So upto you and I don't recommend to play High end games in this as of heating issue which is in the genes of Snapdragon 801 soc processor. Well this is it.  Thanks for reading it. If you have 20000 /- wait for yutopia then or else go for this blindly. Remember  it comes with previous applied screen protector and now this time with transparent back cover also. Thanks for reading this.  Hit like if you find it helpful to you.
p	Just received the Phone. Here is the Initial review of the Phone: Build: The build for the phone feels solid, Glass front and back, Attracts a LOT of fingerprint. Luckily there is a Silicon Case provided in the box. I would not use the Phone without a protective case. Looks: 10/10, Stunning looks, fashionable for sure. Performance: The phone is smooth and fluid, Does heat up on the top left corner when gaming for 30+ Mins, Dual Sim works fine, yet to test it with a microSD Card. The screen being AMOLED is a BIG ADVANTAGE. It renders neat blacks and bright colors, the best screen by OnePlus as of now. Not much to say at this point about performance, will update the review in a few days. Things to Note: 1. The phone has a pre installed screen guard, take care while removing the front screen cover when out of box, chances are, you will pull the screen guard apart too. 2. Silicone Case is provided in the box. Good move, because there are no other cases available as on date. Cons: The glass build, is nice to have but I would be double cautious with the phone, A single drop might break the screen is what I am scared about. No NFC. But no one used it anyway.
p	This is the undoubtedly the best mobile phone one can get under 20k keeping in mind its brand value, hardware and its absolutely gorgeous looks. To anyone at first glance, it looks like at least a 50k phone. It has a nice slim design, with black glass both at the front and back. The metallic rim has lines engraved for superior grip and feel. Pros:- 1.) Performance : Brilliant performance with no lag whatsoever. Gaming is butter smooth. No complaints here. 2.) Looks : As I have mentioned before, this phone looks costlier than it actually is. It's slim body gives it superior feel. And, surprisingly it is not heavy at all. 3.) Display : It's 1080p AMOLED screen is treat for the eyes. Colour reproduction and pixel density is perfect for crisp sharp display with high colour contrast. I personally like the 5-inch phones because they are easy to handle and operate with one hand. 4.) Camera : The quality of both front(8 MP) and back(12.4 MP)  camera is quite remarkable with sharp images. Low-light images are somewhat grainy but not too bad for my liking.The camera app is stock android with in-built features of Timelapse, Slow-Mo video recording, Panorama etc. Cons : 1.) OxygenOS 2.1 I personally love customizing my Android phone and OxygenOS really lacks in that. With some minimum features like Dark Mode Theme, rearranging of Status bar tiles and the support of a few gestures, CyanogenOS is much better in that respect. But, if you like the stock android feel, then this OS won't disappoint you.It doesn't come preloaded with many apps and is very close to Stock Android OS that comes loaded in the Moto and Nexus Series. 2.)It is a Dual SIM OR a Single SIM + SD Card. You cannot have a Dual SIM + SD card. It uses the SIM2 slot as SD card slot. So if you want a Dual SIM + SD card, this will disappoint you. 3.) After Sales Support. Oneplus as a company is indeed trying to improve its customer support but currently it is not upto the mark. With very few Service Centers available, it could be a hassle for you if the need of servicing arises. Overall Verdict: OxygenOS is still in its infancy. I am sure future updates will give it more customisabality. And if you are a customization freak, I am sure you can flash the ROM of your choice ;) For me, it is the best 17k I have ever spent. PS: I will add some Camera photos for you to judge soon.
n	One plus x doesn't allow u to choose the SIM to make a call. Whatever preference u set in call settings, either of ur two sims is used to call irrespective of ur choice. Called their technical support n they said the issue will b resolved in next oxygen update. Keeping fingers crossed. Till then wud advise u guys to not purchase it. Hope this issue gets resolved, else will return my one plus x on Amazon n maybe buy a moto x play...
n	Waited in the queue for Invite. Received the invite yesterday and have placed the order. Received the product today and was excited to open and review the unit. And here comes the disappointment. The display of the phone was damaged. Not the thing which I was expecting from One plus. I have been using One plus One from past one year and did not had any issue. After seeing this damaged product I think One plus is planning to lose customers base in India. Hoping to get the replacement unit as soon as possible.
n	Worst phone with soo many issues. Will never refer it to any body First the battery drains off very often. Second the screen freezes like multiple times a day. Third the speaker is too low is like listening from the farthest end of the world or under the water. For all these issues when contacted the customer care the response makes you feel its the most bad choice made. They say they dont guarantee the software and top of it i had bad screen freeze problem which they said is software issue. Hope the consumers are educated about this phone before they buy it.
n	This review is specifically made to mention that the phone takes hell lot of time to get fully charged min 2 hrs, and battery drains early when compared to charging rate. The phone is good on performance but as everyone said the 'best deal in its price', its not so look is mind blowing, works smoothly but battery charge and drain ration is something i could not ignore So be informed. Thanks.
n	Hi Everyone, Please read this review before you consider buying the Oneplus X. The biggest issue many users are facing including me is the dual SIM bug in the Oxygen OS 2.1.3. Let me explain in detail, I am a dual sim user and was using Moto G2 previously which had dual sim slots & a Micro SD slot (Not complaining about the Oneplus X's hybrid sim slot). Since Oneplus X had ample internal memory (11 GB for users), I inserted two nano SIMs and started testing the call quality, At first when I made a call from SIM2, the carrier displayed was of SIM1, I thought I was confused between my carriers and went and checked the SIM 1 & SIM 2 carriers. Then as I began calling again from SIM2, I noticed that the calls go from SIM1 by default even when you select SIM2. This was a major setback for me. I started searching if I was the only one facing this problem, I found that this was a major issue across Oneplus 2 & Oneplus X users. Even the Oneplus India Customer support acknowledged this issue and asked me to wait for an OTA Fix!!!(Kudos Oneplus Team for asking the customer to wait rather than replacing the one day new mobile. What an awesome Support team u guys have.). When I raised it on twitter I received similar answers asking to do a factory reset which I did and  the problem still persists. Another bug is that, the call history in the dialer does not show the names of the recently called even if the contact number is saved in google account. I had to use a third party dialer (Truedialer) to overcome the bug. Even though this mobile is loaded with awesome specs and the performance for the two days that I used was fantastic, the Oneplus team couldn't even get the basics right for their so called Mobiles including their Flagships (OP2). I switched back to my old Moto G2 and it was a bliss to use. Team Oneplus: NEVER SETTLE huh!! Seriously think of changing your tagline to something more believable like "CHALE THO CHAAND TAK NAHI THO SHAAM TAK"
p	Xiaomi is just a one-year-old brand for India and it took only one year to beat all other old and big brands just because of their business model, price, quality and MIUI. The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give best. I have bought all Xiaomi India products and none of them required to visit a service center to date. The first device they launched in India was the MI3 and I got it in the first sale and it still works like the new device. The Redmi Note Prime is the not the latest Note device they have in the International market, as they have already launched Redmi Note 2, Redmi Note 2 Prime and the Redmi Note 3 in the international market but they all have the MediaTek processor and they have been prohibited from sale these MediaTek phones in India due to some patent issues, so they launched the Redmi Note Prime with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 (which is not outdated yet) especially for the Indians and made in India. ----------------------------- UPDATE(14/01/2016) ----------------------------- Xiaomi will launch Redmi Note 3 variant with Snapdragon 650 SoC especially for India in coming months but I don't think it will carry a price tag under 10k as it has upgraded Snapdragon 650 chip, 16MP camera and a big 4000mAh Big Battery and full metal body. So you can still choose Redmi Note Prime if you are low on budget. ----------------------------- UPDATE(25/01/2016) ----------------------------- According to some reviews people reporting battery drain because of Mediaserver. Let me clear it that it's not a hardware fault, Some corrupt or MKV files on internal or external storage(SD card) that media server tries to index and it results in endless looping and it causes heating with battery drain. Quick Fix For Battery Drain: Delete all MKV files from the internal and external storage and restart the phone. Hope it helped..!! ------- PROS: ------- 1. MADE IN INDIA (Check the image) 2. MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most customizable,  powerful, features packed android user interface. You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps. 3. Overall good built quality, and especially the camera lens has the O-ring around it to protect it from scratches even if you use it without cases/covers. 4. Stunning 13.97cm (5.5") HD IPS display. (Bigger the display more the productivity.) 5. Fast 2GB LPDDR3 RAM with 16GB Flash memory with read speed of 100MB/s and write speed of 50MB/s. (Faster the memory, lesser the loading and launching time of the apps) 6. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 1.2GHz quad-core processor. It also has a 64-bit capability, which is faster and more powerful than 32-bit processors and allows for more efficient processing and memory use. 7. Adreno 306 supports DirectX, OpenCL, FlexRender and other PC gaming technologies for a richer gaming support and experience. 8. The menu, Home and Back keys are red backlit keys, looks sexy. (Check the image) 9. 4G, Dual sim and MircoSD slot. 10. The excellent output from the 3.5mm jack, all you need is a good pair of earphone. I tested it with XB70AP. 11. Big 3100 mAh high-capacity battery coupled with power efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and the battery saving features of MIUI makes it one of the most longer battery life smartphone. 12. 13MP rear camera | 5MP front camera are not the best 13MP and 5MP camera but it performs better than many phones and best at this price tag. 13. Good quality 2amp charger. -------- CONS: -------- 1. Big for the 5.5-inch screen size, not for the people who are looking for a pocket-friendly phone. I have added a picture of Redmi Note Prime without any case and my OnePlus One with bulky Diztronic Ultra TPU Case on it and they seem the same size. 2. Glossy back, I'm not a good fan of glossy stuff as they get scratched very easily and visibility of scratches are high also the glossy surface feel a bit sleepy in hands than the matte surface. I have added the picture of it with its little sister Redmi 2 with the matte finish on the back. 3. There is no space on the bezel or in the back panel where you can put your nail/finger and open it. 4. The speaker is placed on the back side and the output from the speaker in all Xiaomi phones is average or below average in this case this phone won't be audible in the noisy environment and from the another room. 5. MIUI7 used in this phone has the base of Android KitKat 4.4.4 which is 2 years  old android version. --------------- VERDICT: --------------- You can't ask for more at this price tag, Redmi Note Prime is the best 5.5-inch screen phone at this price tag. If you are low on budget and want a big screen, long battery life and full featured packed phone then you can blindly go for the Redmi Note Prime. PS: I am providing some pictures of the product for better understanding as "A picture can speak a Thousand words"(I already wrote more than 500 words). Just in case, you like my review don't forget to hit the 'YES/HELPFUL' button below. It does encourage me to buy stuff from amazon for review.
p	Very good value for money.. Battery is good. Interface is bit tricky to use initially especially if you are switching from standard android interface. Wifi tends to disconnect frequently. Otherwise no issues.. Screen is excellent but camera is average
p	Guys!! If u are getting faulty product..then please buy from MI.COM, there is very less chance(like  zero percent) to get faulty product... And trust me phone is totally worth it for price....people,who are seeking for high specs, can go for apple or anywhere else.. Those who are talking about heating issues must understand that if u are playing games, using internet etc. while charging, then obviously it will get heated...any phone will get heat....even iphone also heats..if you are doing so many things while charging... One more thing battery should always be in 40 to 80 percent..i mean always keep ur battery above 40 percent( BATTERY SHOULD ALSO BREATH PROPERLY OK!!) for better battery, healthy battery and heating issues. >>FOR ALL SMARTPHONES.<< GUYS MIND IT!!! IF U HAVE BELOW 40% BATTERY, IT WILL HEAT EVEN ONLY IF U TALK. . CAMERA,BATTERY AND DISPLAY TOTALLY JUSTIFIES. When you receive the product, firstly u must update and secondly you should do factory reset, then use it.. mi.com delivered the phone to me in 46 hours.
p	Mobile worked fine. I recd the sealed box which had empty pouch of earphone.  How will I get them
p	i love it
n	Xiaomi played a Trick here but i am not sure if it would work. This phone is Actually The Redmi Note 4G, but with a Different name and an extra Sim Slot....What is New in this then ?? Same 1 year Old Model I dont understand WHY to launch an already Discontinued devices when you have a Lot of devices (Mi 5 which might never launch i guess) Xiaomi India is taking credit of it but i dont see anything NEW as such in the phone. The Company is NOT launching any good phone now like REDMI NOTE 3 & REDMI NOTE 3 PRIME , due to Legal issues. You launch Good devices in CHINA and launch such devices which dont sell there anymore ,to dispose off in India. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE. And customers should make it clear to such brand that there are Many other Brands Which we can Opt. Its not that Only Xiaomi is the One in Market. If INDIAN Customers have given Xiaomi that Market BOOST , They can take that Back too. Atleast it should keep in Mind that INDIAN users are Not to be Served an OUTDATED phone. We want better specifications too which have been launched worldwide. This launch by Xiaomi shows they just want to OUTSTOCK their Old phones , and surprisingly customers are happy with this also. I dont find any good reason to Buy this phone being an model 1 year Old , just a Big Publicity Launching would Not make it go Far..!! THIS IS OUTDATED ....Not recommended at All !!! LIKE THIS COMMENT TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT EVEN WE WANT UPDATED PHONES WHICH ARE LAUNCHED WORLDWIDE AND SUCH DEVICES ARE NOT ACCEPTED BEING OUT OF MARKET TRENDS...!!!
n	hi Dear  5 star Keyboard warriors .Please read my reviews and give expert advice . I brought this phone last week and in 3 days these are the defects i found 1 . ii have attached the screen shot for reference . This phone has a media server app that takes almost 70 % of your battery . This app cannot be force stopped (this app is used to scan all media files and refresh in your gallery). So if you charge your phone 100 % it will be 65 % in jus half and hour even on standby because of this app. And the back panel of phone heats so much that its is very useful during winter to keep you warm :P. Trust me my pant gets warm as soon i slide my phone in pocket in jus 3 minutes.Mounting External SD card will make the media server app go worse . So solution is dont add any files on your phone to keep media server quite and get high battery life.. 2 The apps cannot be moved to memory card so you have to use the only 11 gb space available in phone for apps (half will be consumed by whats app :P ) . and don even think of rooting the phone ,if you root by seeing the you tube videos (MOST ARE ONLY FOR REDMI PRIME /REDMI NOTE 4G) .If u root it any ways you wont get any updates to install. 3 there is no search option in music player provided in phone , so if u like that one song among 700 songs you have to scroll way down to get that one song to listen.So if you install any other music app which has search option, it will only scan your internal storage songs not external storage songs. I have reported all these bugs to xiaomi , still no action taken ..oooops i forgot why will they take any action .. i already got scammed with 8500 rs by them :P online chat and support  numbers also dont respond :D only updates and fixes can save my phone. this is all i could find the most non user friendly thing in this outdated phone in 3 days . will post more on this . OVERALL I HAVE MADE YET ANOTHER STUPID DECISON IN MY LIFE AND STILL LAUGH ABOUT IT :D
n	What the hell is going on at Xiaomi ? Same spec, same design and worst of of when all the other phones are moving to Android Marshmallow, but they are still stuck with Kit Kat. Piece of crap.. they seem to be dumping useless, unmarketable devices from China to India.. my  Advice: DON'T buy this crap !!!!
n	Not worth for the price and all specs are outdated. In China they released redmi note 3 with fingerprint and 4000 mah battery. They think India is dumping ground. Better go for Coolpad.
n	I'm an MI user for the last 6 months. I order Xiaomi Redmi Note Prime (White, 16 GB) for my family member but got a BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT the moment we insert the SIM. I had faith on MI so initially i thought it might be a bug and restart it but nothing happen. And the following porblem remain same : 1. Never shut down, only restart 2. Keypad " I " (for India) never worked. When we press I, it works as Backspace. Funny huh. 3. All apps runs at once or whenever the app wants it. 4. Think if your Mobile data gets on / off automatically when all the apps are running. 5. Even the worst part it can call to any number at any time automatically, even normal lock. finally we felt to return the phone. Requested AMAZON and the next day some resources came to pick the phone and within 2-3 days we got the money back in our account. Thanks AMAZON.
p	This is not a competition for your usual android tablets. There is simply no comparison because it is PC in a tablet form factor. If you think of a tablet just as an enlarged version of a smartphone, you will find it very costly. However, if you love your apple devices, then you will love this and appreciate the difference in quality and performance. It runs the full windows 10 OS so anything and everything you can do on your PC, you can do it here. Some people have commented about battery and heating issues, but I believe that was in some devices and firmware updates have been out already to address those. I have seen this device run all day and it gets only moderately warm. My dell latitude gets that much warm in about half an hour. even Intel i5 is more than enough processing power for all that one could think of baring someone having a need to do animation programming or run very heavy games on it. for those, you have to go for i7 version. Now the fun part. Its form factor. We are talking about a serious laptop, but it is just 8 mm in thickness and you can literally hide it inside a photographer's jacket. It is incredibly light, yet very sturdy and strong. I do hope that type cover was included in this price because it is a must have. It is a perfect device for those planning to buy an iPad or Macbook. It is a must for those who want both an iPad and a Macbook.
p	Let's start with the golden question of Indian masses i.e. battery life, I've been getting ~6-7 hours of battery life on the SP4 which is quite nice. I would recommend this tablet for professionals that walk or travel a lot, and do NOT need all day battery on a single charge. The new Surface Pen is very nice, with the tail end acting as an eraser. The screen is not too small like the iPad, neither is it bulky like a laptop. The screen resolution is high and text/videos are crisp and easy to read/watch. The magnet on the left side of the SP4 is surprising strong and holds the Surface Pen well.The magnet on the right side is significantly weaker but it can hold the pen well. The kickstand works perfectly and stays in the position I set it to. The SP4 Type Cover feels great and protects your screen when you aren't using it. High end Gamers shouldn't buy it, but it could run some games if you decide to do so.That being said, the gaming experience was rather unpleasant. Software-wise,It looks and performs exactly like Windows 10 should on a normal desktop or laptop. The device is very responsive and has fast storage. The tablet does charge quite quickly. Microsoft is rolling out updates continuously that are addressing most of the issues. The tablet's cameras are also quite good, though I don't consider that a huge plus as I'm not going to be using this for picture taking. I haven't had any overheating issues which was a huge issue on some previous devices and I can't find any issues with the build quality. In short, it's got an amazing screen, solid build quality, is very light, and does not get too hot. Pros:) Pen input that is a step above competition Incredible screen Great performance (running Core i5/128GB model) Sleek, light design Type cover has great feel Integrated kickstand that actually works in all positions Separate magnetic charge connector Expandable storage (micro SD) Cons:( Mediocre battery life Single USB port (which can annoy you at certain situations) Expensive (more with the cover) Mini Display port needs adapter ( can't use directly) At the end of the day,I don't think anyone else offers the performance and quality that the Surface Pro 4 has in the same lightweight and thin chassis.

p	If you are thinking the price is worth or not..let me tell you it definitely is! It is not a tablet. It is a proper full fledged laptop which is also a tablet. Desktop softwares and apps both work flawlessly. External hdd, cd drive, external display, SD card all work! Also it is has a pencil which beats all the styluses before. Its a future of all laptops.
p	Watch this review of surface pro.. solution of all your FAQ : https://youtu.be/DimKX9YdhG8
p	Bought surface pro 4 256 GB when it was still not available in India. I was very sceptical about this device in the beginning, but slowly and steadily it won my heart over by its charm. This is an awesome device, packed with power and style. Do not be let down by the joker posts giving it 1,2,3 rating. Its a 5 star device. The built is very good, the form is beautiful and weights like a feather. It's screen is best ever in the world and is too good to believe. The speed is good too. But , yes there is a BUT here also. The battery is avg. There is this and only this problem, to this otherwise God device. It gives around 4 to 5 hours on battery which I wished to be better. And, the price. But every premium ting comes at a price. I bought it in $1299 which is a bit cheaper that in India. Overall, I just love this device.
n	You're probably looking at purchasing this device because you're intrigued by this form factor. It really is a tablet that can transform into a laptop, and even a desktop, given the right accessories, (more on that later). It's light. It's reasonably quick. I have the 4 GB Ram, 128 GB SSD version, and it performs most daily tasks with ease. Performance You can't really expect this configuration to play high end games. But mobile games (like the ones you buy off the windows store) are playable. I don't work in Autocad and Adobe Photoshop but people have run those kinds of software on it. Just not very well. Still, it would work in a pinch. When running more CPU intensive tasks, the fans run up to a very audible whir. It didn't bother me personally. But it's not like an iPad for example. It is a full fledged i5 CPU so that is expected. But internet browsing and office work great. Battery life It's decent at best. I have got upto 5 to 6 hours using multiple chrome tabs. It's not as good as say a Macbook Pro or Macbook Air, but it's not bad for a pc this small and this thin. As a tablet The form is great. A tad on the heavier side. Where it fails as a tablet is the way it goes to sleep and wakes up. Just don't expect it to turn on instantly after it's been lying around idly for long. Also, even with all the work Microsoft has put into Windows 10, it does not feel complete. Buttons are frequently too small to click on. You can customise your display scaling, but not everything scales up correctly. A lot of software is not optimised for High DPI screens. Though this can change, we're in 2016 and these resolutions have been around for several years now, and I am personally tired of waiting. As a laptop I also bought the surface pro 4 type cover when it came out, don't bother buying the surface pro 3 type cover, it's TERRIBLE in comparison. The new one has the larger trackpad and keys that are nicer to type on. But both type covers will quite frequently stop working, especially when you resume from sleep. Usually, a simple disconnect and reconnect will make it work. Other times a restart is required. Yes, even now. Even after all the software updates. The mouse just stops responding to the trackpad. What is surprising is that this is Microsoft's own baby. As a Desktop I also bought the surface pro dock. This gives you an additional 4 USB ports and two mini display ports. Which is great. The ports are USB 3.0 and transfer are fast. As a notebook. It's quite functional for note taking. I've used it extensively to take hand written notes and markup pdfs. This is in fact the number one reason you should even consider this device. If you don't need a pen to write on your screen with, you really should question why you would purchase this device at all. Now the bad stuff. The software is too flaky. I've been patiently waiting for over a year for things to sort out. Microsoft has regularly provided updates and some of the initial issues have gone away. But many have not and frequently, new ones crop up. The wifi would regularly not connect after waking up from sleep. This appears to have been fixed. The touchpad frequently does not respond, especially waking up from sleep. This is still an issue. The pen button sometimes fails to open Onenote like it's supposed to. The pen sometimes acts like it's "Touching" even though you're just hovering, making it impossible to write with. This just comes and goes even though I haven't done anything differently.  I've owned several galaxy note devices for the last 4 years, and it's NEVER happened like this before. I've tried calling microsoft support in India, and I've just been passed around from one department to another eventually reaching an overseas call centre which was closed during our working times. Oh, and because the power button juts out of the body, it is very easy to wake up the device while it's lying in your bag. I've carried a fully charged device from home only to find it completely drained when I take it out hours later. No device is really perfect. I've also found my Macbook Pro to behave unexpectedly. But it's never been with such frequency with such basic actions such as the touchpad. I know people who also have the surface pro 4 and still have sleep/wake issues. I know the issues will eventually go away. But my advice to you now would be to save your money unless you really really need that pen. Even then there are a LOT many more options out there. Another thing to consider is that this device is especially overpriced in India. In a word; should you buy this? No.
n	Had to return the product since the Tab started giving trouble from the day1. Had to reboot 3 times. Pencil stopped responding. I hope hogher models with 8 GB Ram will perform better.
n	To be clear, I wanted a light weight product which can run full suite of applications and it portable. Surface Pro 4 seemed like an ideal product for this purpose. I per-ordered it. But after using it for 3 days, I returned it back to Amazon. It was over all very nice, but it was not as good as you would like a Rs 1,33,000( 121k + 12k) product to be. Pros: Very lightweight and portable. Pro + Keyboard weight just less than 1100 grams in total. Very Powerful. I got the one with i5 processor. It was able to handle multiple applications simultaneously easily. Awesome Display. Running 4k videos 267 ppi screen looks great. Touch Screen. It felt really good to be able to use the Pro 4 in Tablet mode. Cons: Too many software bugs. It was the main issue that forced me to return the surface pro 4. Examples: - Sometimes attached keyboard type cover will stop responding and then you have to detach and reattach it. - Other times touchscreen will stop responding with keyboard and then you have to detach keyboard. - Sometimes tablet will not come out of sleep mode and you have to press power button 4-5 times. - Screen has a very high resolution and many application on windows do not scale properly. For example, in VLC player, control icons like play pause buttons were way too small. - Sometimes windows will try to scale scaling incompatible applications and it will completely tear the application apart.  You might end up with things like overlapping buttons. I know a lot of these issues might be ironed out in future software updates, but in a device that costs as much as Surface Pro 4 you expect a smooth experience at purchase itself. Only one USB port. I connected my surface Pro 4 with external monitor to get some work done and then realized that I cannot connect external keyboard and mouse at the same time. And keep in mind, Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI converted was extremely difficult to find and it was quite expensive. Kickstand: Although It looks sturdy, I feel like it might give away within a year or two of use. One other problem, I generally use laptops in my lap and I constantly change positions (My problem, I know), but every time I change position I have to change the position of kickstand. Battery Life: Mediocre battery life. Battery drained in 4 hrs of you tube streaming on a good WiFi connection. Not enough support: In India, as of now, there is no way to extent warranty of Surface Pro 4. Surface Pro 4 is extremely difficult to open and lot of parts are glued in. Even a simple task as replacing battery could be a headache without support. I don't know how much will it cost if there is any hardware defect after the expiration of warranty. Overall - If you are looking for a Tablet which you can sometimes also use as a Laptop, this is ideal product. But if you are planning to replace you laptop with a surface pro 4, that might not be a good decision. Note: After returning Surface Pro 4, I ordered a Mac-book Pro 13 with Retina Display. I am a first time Mac user and I am absolutely loving it. Yes, there are some software limitations, but overall experience is far better than Surface Pro 4.
n	Though I say it's awesome and all my friends have it but the thing is I need it atleast for 75000₹ To buy it
n	Really for good.
