p	I have heard a lot about this classic and so couldn't stop buying.It's about the lessons that two children Jem and Scout learn in their life as they grow.Here are some of the beautiful words that I admire from the book: 1."shoot all the bluejays you want,if you can hit'em but remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird " 2.you don't understand someone until you put yourself in their shoes 3.It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.You rarely win,but sometimes you do. 4.but before I can live with other folks I've to live with myself. The narrator puts this at the end: "There's nothing much to learn now anyways,except probably algebra".That's what even you feel when you finish it and remember that it's a CLASSIC.Go for it without a second thought.
p	I think it's a pirated copy. The page quality is very poor and overall book binding is not so good. I am giving it four star only because this is a very good book.
p	I had ordered this initially for my niece but ended up reading it myself. The book is a great read: especially for mature teenagers. It is a charming story and takes you to a quaint old world where elders and women are shown due respect, notwithstanding the racial tensions. The author has  the rare capability to shownegative characters in a positive light. The print quality is decent enough for the price.
p	A wonderful story written from a little girl's point of you. Relived every moment of my childhood reading it. This one my altime favourite in classics. Author  succeeded completely in showcasing racism, the vulnerability of those affected by it and the resistance to change against racial discrimination in his time sensibly. A must read by everyone. Can't give anything less than 5. Happy reading
p	Beautiful read. you will go back to your childhood while you read. Characters are so nicely constructed that you will wish you had them in your life. considering the time this classic was written and its kind school-teacher like stand against racism, this book is simply "brilliant". Loved reading it. Will read it again and again. will occupy a special spot in my bookshelf forever! :)
n	I wasn't expecting sucha poor quality product from amazon. The quality of the pages is terrible.  Its like an old book issued from the library..
n	It's a very good book. Harper Lee has beautifully described the thoughts of a kid. A must read. PS : The rating is for the content of the book and not the book itself. PPS : I didn't like the quality of the page of the book that was delivered to me.
n	Service was good.... but product quality was poor.....
n	The book is small in size, but the print is solid and legible. The cover has an embossed feel to it which is a plus. It came with a bookmark and the discount made the whole deal a good buy.
n	paper quality is poor, looks like pirated book.
p	A great book which gives you loads of insights about critical questions of history. Why did human beings became all-too-powerful, rather than their ancestral brothers (Neanderthals) or cousins (apes)? What role did fire play in our early supremacy? How did the advent of agriculture changed human society? How did religion come about, and how did it become a binding-force (counter-intuitively) which helped human beings conquer other animals? How did money and consumerism flourish? At this rate of scientific progress, what's our future? Each line of this book is insightful. The writing is immensely readable. Buy this book - you will not regret it. This is the kind of history you never read - history mixed with insights from economics, biology, psychology and sociology. Reading the book will make you intellectually richer. You will look at the world differently.
p	One of the most fascinating books on the origin and evolution of the species Homo Sapiens. It is full of brilliant insights. You will likely learn something new in every chapter, if not every page. One example: What makes human beings different from all other animals and made them the masters of this planet ? According to the author, it is their ability to imagine things which do not exist and concoct elaborate fictions. This allows members of this particular species of great ape (who individually could achieve very little) to collaborate with vast numbers of other members of the species Sapiens, most of whom are perfect strangers, to achieve astonishing things from hunting down mammoths to building the International Space Station. Most of us do not realize this, but Goddess Laxmi, United States, money or Manchester United are just a few of these imaginary entities which exist ONLY in the collective imaginations of vast numbers of people and causes them to behave in certain ways and collaborate and coordinate with one another. Without mythologies there won't be any of those networks we call civilization. The more complex the civilization, the more elaborate the fictions must be. Going through the book, one is astonished by the range of author's knowledge. Although in some places the author allows his personal biases to show through, I would recommend this book very highly to all those who want a broad sweeping view of human evolution.
p	What is wonderful book. Harari sketches out the origins of our species and then goes on to describe a historically validated account of hunter gatherers traansforming into farmers and then on to workers during the industrial revolution. Frankly I found Harari's arguments unimpeachable. The only sore point is his insistence that all mammals are born heterosexual and that there is no causal link to the theory Opposite Sexes Attract. This may be as the author himself is a gay. Barring this aberration I feel the time, effort and money I invested in this book were well worth it. I would recommend it to anyone having a keen sense of history.
p	A superlative overview of major historical trends which have affected mankind. Prof. Harari's point of view is unique unusual and extremely refreshing. I enjoyed this book immensely both for its historical analysis and well argued analysis. I highly recommend it to both history buffs and even casual readers. I hope there is more from Prof Harari and I eagerly await it. I am also looking forward to a course on the same topic which he takes on Coursera.
p	This is a unique book that presents both anthropological, historical and current ways of humankind. As can be expected, the book steadily moves on from the science of biology (genes) that governed the primitives to the methods of economics (mind) that is controlling our lives. We are able to see how from local tribes we have grown into a unified sort of society. There is a clear and frank presentation of those diabolical and inhuman traits of the sapiens, coming out through their acts down the history. The book touches on what future may hold for us. On the whole, it is a very different kind of book I have read. I am happy to find that there is objectivity in what the author has to say, and even more, I was happy to find that he has a heart as he shows his leaning towards the underdogs in all situations.
n	Brilliant in parts but pretty ordinary in the rest. Dr. Harari seems to let his personal preferences get the better of himself in parts. While he talks about several myths he espouses several myths - that resources available are infinite, academics have caused progress (read Antifragile by Nassim Taleb) , scientists solve human problems, medicine has benefitted mankind (please read Death by Medicine by Gary Null). Well in parts all of these myths are true but would have appreciated Dr. Harari going into the details of conflicts of interest and other biases that prevent these institutions from doing what they are supposed to do. Did like the book in parts and several insights are remarkable but this book proves that it is very difficult for a person who has been institutionalised to write an honest account of the institution. He is too much of a scientist/academic to do justice to the true record of science/academia. A much better book on all counts would be Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
n	Well had thought it will be about human history, but the the writer has imposed his beliefs and not the history as it happened
n	this is really a good read and in phases it is brilliant.
p	This is an excellent book written by Carl Sagan. It tells us about our glorious past, the lost knowledge, the fall of our society in the medieval times and how people saved the knowledge. Also it tells us about the universe and stars in detail but any reader from non- scientific background can easily understand it. The title tells it all!!!
p	First off, Kudos to the Amazon India team. Their quality of service is amazing. I was constantly kept in the loop about the status of my package and the delivery guy promptly called me just 10 minutes before to verify whether I was home or not. About packaging, the book was wrapped in a bubble wrap which was well insulated from external environment and the rain water (It was heavily raining in Delhi when I received the order.). The whole thing was then put into your standard Amazon bag, which in itself was pretty thick. Overall, nice packaging. Now, about the book. It's frickin' awesome. Carl Sagan has been quoted many times to be the greatest science writer and popularizer ever born. This book contains the journey of our universe from that giant compressed stuff called the singularity to the present world in which we live in. This book will radically change your view and outlook on things and will flip your brain right side up! Highly recommended and must read in one's lifetime. GO FOR IT!
p	Just got it today, really a great book! But the only thing I am disappointed about is the corner of the book was damaged when I received this item, did not expect this from Amazon. Nevertheless, everything else is fine with the item, really interesting, if you are in love with Galaxies and stuff, go for it! :D
p	Thoughtfully written and narrated by the brilliant Carl Sagan, this book is all you want to know about the cosmos. When did the universe begin? When did life originate? How did galaxies evolve? When will the Sun die? These are some of the questions that the book addresses in a unique and lyrical way. Along with some magnificent pictures taken by spacecrafts that have been exploring the universe for decades, the latest edition also features a new introduction by Sagan's wife Ann Druyan and a new forward by Neil deGrasse Tyson who hosts the new documentary Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey (based on Saga's TV series from the 80s). Hailed as one of the bestselling science books of all time, I reckon it's a good buy.
p	Without a doubt, this book is the best modern sciences book ever written. It focuses not only on physics, which i actually bought it for, but biology, chemistry and even history of astronomy and science, and I never thought that that would interest me. I'm just 15, and Carl has become my idol. His lyrical, lucid language explains the most difficult concepts so effortlessly, it's hard to believe. This book is the ultimate dream come true, for anyone pursuing cosmology/astrophysics, or for even an amateur. Buy this product without any second thoughts or hesitations, you will NOT regret it at all. For all those who idolize Carl, you cannot not read this book and live life.
n	Do not buy this book. It's not worth the money. I got this hideous looking book with a hideous font and an ugly formatting. Would not recommend.
n	the book is small but thick one when you will open it many times it will tear of in many pieces.
n	A good book to read but one will get bored if he has no interest in space and universe.... Chapters are quite lengthy and require great deal of patience.... All together a good book if you want to know about origin of life on earth and how we are here.. The service by Amazon is too good. They gave huge discount and also delivered for free.... Hats off Amazon....
n	Language is too advanced for starters
n	pictures are not good ; b&w;
p	I started reading this book as the title caught my attention 'A Short History of Nearly Everything'. Well, it exceeded all my expectations. Brynson captures all the essence of life and science through the lens of a ten year old child. He does not shy away from asking very "dumb questions" regarding all nature's phenomenon, which surprisingly leads him through  time and space of mankind's understanding of nature and life's role in it. Another interesting aspect is that author has done painstaking research of 3 years to get all the stories right, thus giving credit to real inventors & discoverers. He manages all this through very humourous and insiightful commentary and takes pain to dumb down complicated concepts so we undertand its fundamentals as well as its importance. If you have not read this yet, pick one up right now and get going on this fun filled nature voyage. This book is a keeper and can be read to again to get get our stories straight !
p	Everything from the beginning of time. Here's one confusion I had - I didn't know it covered the history of everything based on SCIENCE. So a little different than what I thought - doesn't cover how civilizations came to be, how economies developed, etc. So if you're looking for something like that, this won't do it. However, it is filled more fun-stories that one can probably recollect. Enjoyed it.
p	This is one of the few books I would always recommend. This book has the maximum amount of knowledge that I've ever learnt from a book, presented in a very interesting and structured fashion. I haven't ever read a book that provides information on so many topics in such a lucid manner. All presented in an interesting storytelling manner unique of Bill Bryson!
p	A brilliantly written book in which popular writer Bill Bryson vividly describes how the world came in to existence and answers many thoughtful questions. We are taken through an epic journey right from the big bang to the rise of civilization, all explained in a plain and simple language. Through his experiences of living in several countries, Bryson gathers information from various museums, interviews many experts and visits places on earth where fossils were found or which have mysterious geographical formation. We hear many fascinating stories from different corners of the planet; and find interesting facts about the universe, the earth, the sun and other planetary bodies that have riddled mankind for many centuries. Bill Bryson is no scientist but a traveler through space and time with in-depth knowledge on science.
p	An eyeopening  journey from the depths of science i.e. from big bang to the nano world everything covered beautifully. The best part about this book is the flow which is very smooth and non technical. We would imagine that a book of this nature should have been written by a scientist. But Bill Bryson being a non scientist did a better job of bringing out scientific history in easily readable form, which a non scientific person can easily digest. This book helps us to revisit scientific subjects with a better  perspective since we have left our schools ( as i am a commerce graduate). Worth reading for every one.
n	Not a basic approach....
n	Well, when I saw the title of the book - I thought it will be indeed a short history of nearly everything but as I started reading, I realized that it's not at all short history instead it's a history of nearly everything. What we learn in this book is apart from science is how insane or competitive were the scientist who invented most of the things in science.  As titled suggested 'A Short History of nearly everything' not everything is covered in this book, for example philosophy, religion, economics, politics, medicines, computers etc. What actually covered in this book is - physics, atoms, big bang, quantum physics, gravitation, (so called) evolution, dinosaurs etc. What you learn reading this book is - what you should have learnt as a student of science. This book answers many question which we wanted to know as a child when we were in school, for example - how on earth scientist know exactly the weight of earth or how the figured to weight of atoms or how the knew the atom can be divided into quarks etc. Overall a pretty good read for anyone who wants to know about science and beware it's not short history - the book is very dense and you might need some long reading hours to complete it.
p	This book carries a lot of nostalgia. I remember my father purchasing the book and spending time to read over that. To be very honest, it was about 12 years from now. My knowledge on physics, rather on cosmology was very limited. Years pased in, but I never looked back to understand the book. I spent hours understanding the concepts of physics, tensors, linear algebra, Minkoski's space time and diagram, general relativity. As years passed, the romanticism for black holes, neutron stars vanished and what emerged out of my knowledge, is purely mathematical concepts, ideas and most importantly those abstract mathematical concepts slowly settled in my mind and took a form, a shape: Black holes, big bang or otherwise.....These again are purely mathematical concepts, later witnessed by Hubble space telescope to get evidence. For readers who are thinking that it is a very simple book, casual read, sitting on sofa or while traveling, surely this is NOT THE BOOK for you. This is a book which is written by one of the greatest scientist of our generation who has been given the honor with Einstein. Well, before understanding 'A Brief History of Time' we should understand who is writing the book. He is Dr.Hawking, the Lucasian Prof.of Mathematics, the position awarded to Sir Isaac Newton,Jospeh Larmor, George Stokes, Paul Dirac. Since 1663-2009, only 18 professors were awarded this position, one of the highest award in the world of mathematics. So, we understand what level of mathematics he would be assuming us to know. Why the book is popular? When Hawking went to Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of of astronomy books ar Cambridge University Press, he asked to drop all the equations in his draft, except one, E=mc^2. Dr.Hawking's motto was to reach to buyers in airport, specifically to the mass, which definitely would have made it half if there would have been equations and that is the reason, why the book is so difficult. If you think that you can explain mathematics in simple English, then everybody would have been Dr.Hawking. The first edition came up in 1988. In 1974, Carl Sagn recounts:"I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton....." What this book is all about? 'A Brief History of Time' is an attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the nonspecialist reader. The idea is is to give an overview of the subject but, unusual for a popular science book, it also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. What is there in the book? Chapter 1 Our Picture of the Universe: A basic idea of the history and development of cosmology starting from Ptolemy's Universe, Copernicus, Galileo to the current understanding. Chapter 2 Space & Time: Things start to become a little bit weird from this chapter. (a) Galilean relativity and measurement (b) Newton's laws of motion (c) Emerging ideas of gravity (d) James Clerk Maxwell's emergence of the famous theory of electromagnetism -- The first step towards unification, unifying 2 separate forces, electric and magnet into one. (I would recommend to read Daniel Fleisch's 'A student's guide to Maxwell's equations') Dr. Hawking then introduces, Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, how Einstein used Maxwell's equations, the constancy for the speed of light, Lorentz transformation. (I would recommend readers to have a thorough understanding of Lorentz transformation, using Euclid's postulate of h^2=b^2+p^2 and what is a Lorentz factor). Hawking introduces the idea of light cones, where the event will travel. Actually, it is better first to read Minkowski's diagram of space time before going through this chapter. Then comes the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. Here Prof.Hawking quickly introduces, Einstein's magnum opus: The General Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space time, gravity is no longer a force which Newton predicted in F=G.m1.m2/r^2, but a geometry of space time. Recommended reading: Hartle's Gravity, An Introduction to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity Chapter 3 The Expanding Universe: (a) Hubble's observation (b) Doppler effect (c) The red shift (c) Friedmann model. Here. Prof.Hawking starts introducing the concept of singularity: the extreme prediction of General relativity and his favourite subject the BLACK HOLE. The emergence of Penrose-Hawking theorem: a situation where matter is forced to be compressed and compacted to a point (a space-like singularity) and a situation where light rays come from a region with infinite curvature (time-like singularity) Chapter 4 The Uncertainty Principle: Enter the particle zoo, If you take my opinion, this chapter should have been much bigger. It basically explain, the crux of particle physics, Heinsenberg's uncertainty principle. (a) Uncertainty principle (b) Wave particle duality (c) The double-slit experiment and interference pattern and the Schrodinger equation. My dear readers, please please do read a bit of basic quantum mechanics and probability before coming to this chapter. Chapter 5: Elementary Particle & The Forces of Nature: Again, particle physics. Understanding elementary particles, quarks (which makes up proton and neutron). Electron spin, what is a half spin (+1/2 and - 1/2 spin). Integer spin for bosons, Pauli Exclusion principle => Recommended reading: [...]. Most importantly the electro-weak unification by Weinberg-Salam theory. So, we now have only 3 major forces of nature as per the Standard Model: (1)Electro-weak (a sum of electromagentism and weak force) (2) Gravity (3) Strong force. For a better understanding please look into: Dr.Mani Bhaumik's Code Name God. Chapter 6: Black Holes. Readers, please understand (1)Chandrashekhar Limit (2) Tolman-Volkoff-Oppenheimer Limit (3) What is Schwarzschild radius (4) Clear out the confusion between infinite density and infinite mass; the rest Dr.Hawking makes you understand. Recommend: Kip Thorne's Black holes and time warps. Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black. Here Dr.Hawking explores more into black holes, event horizon. For the first time, Hawking introduces his brilliant work which is called The Hawking radiation (entropy and the 2nd.law of thermodynamics) Chapter 8: The Origin and the fate of Universe: How the universe started and how it might end is talked about in this chapter. Chapter 9: The Arrow of time: Explains about disorder, entropy, the thermodynamic arrow of time. Chapter 10: The unification of physics speaks of the GUT (Grand unified theory) and Dr.Hawking's quest to unify the 3 forces of nature. He mentions that Einstein spent the final years if his life, finding such a unified field theory. Remember, when the book was written, HIGGS-BOSON was not discovered. Now the scenario is different.  Hawking opens discussion with Graviton which falls under boson, an elementary particle, following Bose-Einstein statistics and have half-integer spin. Graviton is still unconfirmed,with mass=0. He introduces string theory, supper symmetry and many advanced concepts. He writes: 'Can God make a stone so heavy that he can't lift it?' He states 3 possibilities: (1) There is a complete unified theory (2) There is no ultimate theory (3) There is no theory of the universe, events cannot be prediced  beyond a certain extent, it occurs randomly and arbitrarily. Dr.Hawking ends the book with an optimists note: 'A complete, consistent, unified theory is only the first step; our goal is a complete understanding of the events around us, and of our own existence.' 'If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason -  for then we would know the mind of God.' Happy reading !!
p	Its a miracle of nature how a physically incapable guy can be mentally so tremendously capable..!! Stephen hawking is one of those names which are labeled as "Great thinkers" and this book will tell you the reason why. Your perception of cosmos will change forever after reading this book. Another thing, unlike other complicated writers,stephen has made rocket science langauge to a child's language which will be very benificial for them who doest hav a sci background. So take ur coffee mug and get ready to embark on a journey of a new cosmos... Bon voyege... ;) Cheers..
p	Mr. Hawking is the blend product of Copernicus, Galileo and Einstein, he brings in life to the old laws of complicated dialect, he breathes on same complex principles discovered by forefathers and rolls bundles of solutions to cosmology mysteries....,
p	This is a very informative and interesting book written by a man known for his  commitments for education and science. I always wanted to have this book since its publication. Amazon made this simple and send it to my doors.
p	Excellent book by stephen hawking. It is a must read for all those who want to know more about black holes and the concept of evolution of the universe. The price by amazon is really challenging and i am sure that no one can offer this book in this price. Excellent delivery time. Overall a perfect 5 for amazon too...
n	It's the brilliant Hawking who forms the bridge between extreme physics only understandable to highly qualified scientists and the common people. But I found it out strange that almost 3/4 th of this book is SAME COPY of the book- 'The Theory of Everything'. Parts of both books are completely same. So except this point all is genius! Thumbs Up to Stephen Hawking.
n	The book starts with basic facts of physics and generate interest in reader's mind but later chapters are complex and difficult to understand for an ordinary reader But it's an effort by theoretical physicist , so he tried to make it as simple as possible and sometime using humor in between. First and last chapter is easily readable for an ordinary reader.
n	A very difficult read! Strictly for people with science background only.
n	Poor quality recycled pages, don't feel like reading the book..
n	The pages of the book is of third class..it looks yellowish & oldish.
p	This is required reading for all budding Entrepreneurs. His insights and advice are very useful for, especially high technology, entrepreneurs. One example is... bigger the market...bigger the competition it attracts. Give up obsessing on market size and Look for small niche market when you start and try to dominate it. The competition may be good for consumers but bad for business and so try to create monopoly in your sphere. Examples are Google, Tesla, Paypal, eBay, Facebook etc.
p	its a must for every budding entrepreneur and/or ambitious executive.. Once you start its difficult to put it down, the lucidity with which the counter-intuitive ideas have been explained is simply marvellous. Its 7 point check list for new business idea is simple, intuitive and effective..  Peter explains it over several chapters and then at one point lists them all at one place. The shear genius and academic rigour coupled with first hand experience at the top of the pyramid makes this book an exceptional read. It was a wonderful journey reading this book in last two days, it must be a at least a year since i finished a book in less than two days cover to cover... .
p	A masterpiece from a person who has been there, done that. How is this for starters: One question the author recommends should be asked is- "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" or its business equivalent- "what valuable company is nobody building?" I think that's powerful. Peter classifies progress into vertical progress (technology led) and horizontal progress (process led), and states that in a world of scarce resources it is only through technology that growth is sustainable. Stating that success comes from having a monopoly position, Peter identifies the elements of such a position as  proprietary technologies (or knowledge), network effect, economies of scale, and branding. The author moves between philosophy, his personal experience, advocacy, and technology to offer a compelling insight on how inventors and investors think. I personally liked the seven point check-list on starting a venture, that comprises of the following dimensions: engineering, timing, monopoly, people, distribution, durability, and secrecy. A very good read for managers and founders alike.
p	I would say it's a not that relevant in Indian market, particularly  focused on American market. Peter Thiel is a co-founder of  "paypal" therefore shares his insight on start-ups and how to grow and sustain failures while in process shares how they sold off paypal to ebay. This books also tells some good stories of great personalities like steve jobs , bill gates.
p	Peter Thiel, the cofounder of PayPal, Palantir and Venture Capitalist (Facebook,LinkedIn), offers his insights on how startups turn into successful business ventures and help build the future. Thiel is one of the profound and original thinker of our time. All his recruits are asked one simple question "What important truth you know which very few people agree with you on?" . Although his contrarian question might appears simple , its very difficult to answer. In this book,He offers many original and interesting ideas on monopoly, market, economics. I am particularly fascinated by his critique on "Competition as an ideology and a destructive force" (because the conventional wisdom propagated by economist from almost all economic school agree that competition is good for the product, market, consumer and the competitors) and all his contrarian question helps me see how biased and misinformed I am on many things. Its an important eyeopener for me and an interesting read. Highly recommended.
n	Masters and Thiel take on start ups and building up process is procedural and forward looking.Everyone has something to learn here whether a newbie or a decade old businessman
n	Good for people looking for business oriented books. Was recommended by a person conducting a workshop on business management.
n	Well its ok,a single time read,but definitely a must read for tech entrepreneurs. Not really my type.
n	An essential for a budding entrepreneur
n	Below expectations. Positive comments misguided me. Concepts explained are just having the basic logic and they are far far away from the usability in entrepreneurship. Did not find it much helpful.
p	If you are interested in starting your own business but you are trapped between job (high paid salary) and your business.. must read this! This book has changed my life. I am really happy with how Robert Kiyosaki has explained difference between thinking and implementation (action) of rich and poor.
p	Content of the book is fantastic, while the quality of the mass-market paperback edition is pathetic. Nothing more than a book sold in the road-side worth Rs. 100. If you want a quality print or you want to gift it to someone do not go for this.
p	I can genuinely say this book changed the way I look at life, career and personal development. It kinda opened my eyes. The system is rigged against the small fellow. The more I thought about it more I agreed with Rich Dad. It highlighted to me the perils of depending on salary as primary means of income in today's age. It highlighted importance of investing and generation of passive income from your investments. Rich Dad tells you to invest wisely and earn enough passive income from your investments so as to become financially free and secure. That is the path to financial nirvana. Rich Dad tells us to take responsibility for our financial future and not depend on any corporation or government. I followed many of his advice to good success. It changed my financial life. Its been now 15 years since I first read this book. Lot has been changed in these 15 years. But the advice of Rich Dad is timeless and true. If you listen to him then it will change your life too.
p	A wonderful book to read for all youngsters, those who wish to make a difference in their thinking process in terms of financial success.
p	its very usefull book for those who wants to be rich... never work for money... money should works for you..
n	Its all about making money through your assets. Author is trying to explain this thing again and again which becomes monotonous after certain chapters. I feel like I already knew these things and I would disagree with the author when he says only way to be financial independent is to start our own business. Business is always good but not the only solution.
n	A Very nicely presented book which actually has at least 5 points one can follow concretely.  Usually such books are open ended but Robert did make it a concrete one. There are repetitions but not that annoying. I feel one must read it if not to earn money but to be aware of their un necessary spendings and emotions.
n	This book is a joke, apart from telling you about strong asset building, the book wants to sell you a board game, investing in real estate is the real investment, promoting pyramid marketing scheme and selling lies. People interested further can just google, reach dad poor dad scams.
n	The book tell you once again what your grandparents did again and again, earn - save - spend. But alas, the plastic money generation simply does not understand....and later pays for it. There is some repetition. But otherwise a nice book and still relevant after so many years.
n	An easy read for everyone who is looking to understand the utility of money. The author has described it in the best way for his readers to analyse the tool which is Money. It helps to change readers perception about money.
p	UPDATED 31 December 2014 I've already reviewed this book - Think And Grow Rich ('revised and updated edition' by Arthur R Pell) Published 7 October 2004 by RHUK. But I ordered a second copy of the same title mainly after coming across a review of the revised edition on Amazon.com where one of the reviewer warned buyers to not go with newer/revised edition because it was abridged and missed a lot of information when compared with the original unabridged edition. Well I had got myself the revised/updated R Pell's edition at that time, thinking revised new print will have more content added into it. But as it turned out otherwise, I really did not want to miss a single word from Napoleon Hill's timeless classic, so I thought of going through and here's my review for the Original Unabridged 1937 Edition - Think And Grow Rich. So to answer the questions, does the updated edition which happens to be abridged miss any chapters? Surprisingly, yes. Do we lose a lot of information? Well, not really but it's a question of authorship. Let me explain, the first couple of chapters - Chapter 1: The Secret Of Success, Chapter 2: Thoughts Are Things from the 'Original Edition' are in fact missing in the Arthur R Pell's Updated Edition. I really wanted to make sure, so after going through the two chapters in the Original Edition and reading the updated edition, I learnt that Arthur R Pell has sort of paraphrased those two chapters into one single chapter called 'The Power Of Thought'- (Chapter 1 in newer edition). From then on, the Chapter titles are almost the same in both books apart from Arthur R Pell's lag a chapter behind also has updated examples/case studies. I find this not right because when I bought the newer edition book, I assumed the content would be the same and the newer edition was simply a re-print with a few more case studies/examples added to the original. It is nowhere mentioned on the book that the content itself is modified. But unfortunately, there are a lot of independent publishers who're printing Think And Grow Rich "Updated Edition". So beware of cheap reprints. But honestly speaking, Arthur R Pell has done a fair job with research looking up for newer business moguls, studying their secret to success. So I've secretly kept both the books in my shelf. Anyway going back to the book itself, this book is still my personal favourite inspiration/self-help books that I've ever read in my life. If you are looking for inspiration or something that will motivate you to go after what you desire, this book is the start and I certainly insist you to read it as soon as possible. This book is an in depth analysis on most successful people's life-stories and how they achieved acquiring such wealth. Napoleon Hill had spent decades researching the secret behind their riches. His research started as a poor journalist while working for Andrew Carnegie(Who was one of the richest American industrialists). Andrew Carnegie had asked him to write a case study on 500 most successful people like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman etc who were all interviewed by him. Napoleon Hill learnt the secret behind these people's success and their business empires which was formulated in the form of thirteen steps to achieving success. The book is not just about accumulating money but tells how one can truly achieve anything if one truly desires something wholeheartedly with faith and perseverance no matter the obstacles, in the end one is the victor of life as "Only Life Is Priceless" (Re-quoting from Titanic movie). I strongly encourage everybody to read this book no matter how old you are. Information is more less the same in both books (original and newer revised edition). There are so many books based on Napoleon Hill's success formula - it's sad they don't give enough credit. One of them I can immediately recall is The Secret By Rhonda Byrne. For any budding entrepreneur Think And Grow Rich will certainly help a great deal as Napoleon Hill's ideas are timeless and truly life changing.
p	the best self help book ever. if read with dedication can change your life. the page quality is awesome. its a good source of knowledge and inspiration. i think everyone should read it
p	Read the book not as other book.. Its a book of MAGIC. Can change ur life...Should study the book as prescribed in the book..
p	I've already reviewed this book - Think And Grow Rich ('revised and updated edition' by Arthur R Pell) Published 7 October 2004 by RHUK. But I ordered a second copy of the same title mainly after coming across a review of the revised edition on Amazon.com where one of the reviewer warned buyers to not go with newer/revised edition because it was abridged and missed a lot of information when compared with the original unabridged edition. Well I had got myself the revised/updated R Pell's edition at that time, thinking revised new print will have more content added into it. But as it turned out otherwise, I really did not want to miss a single word from Napoleon Hill's timeless classic, so I thought of going through and here's my review for the Original Unabridged 1937 Edition - Think And Grow Rich. So to answer the questions, does the updated edition which happens to be abridged miss any chapters? Surprisingly, yes. Do we lose a lot of information? Well, not really but it's a question of authorship. Let me explain, the first couple of chapters - Chapter 1: The Secret Of Success, Chapter 2: Thoughts Are Things from the 'Original Edition' are in fact missing in the Arthur R Pell's Updated Edition. I really wanted to make sure, so after going through the two chapters in the Original Edition and reading the updated edition, I learnt that Arthur R Pell has sort of paraphrased those two chapters into one single chapter called 'The Power Of Thought'- (Chapter 1 in newer edition). From then on, the Chapter titles are almost the same in both books apart from Arthur R Pell's lag a chapter behind also has updated examples/case studies. I find this not right because when I bought the newer edition book, I assumed the content would be the same and the newer edition was simply a re-print with a few more case studies/examples added to the original. It is nowhere mentioned on the book that the content itself is modified. But unfortunately, there are a lot of independent publishers who're printing Think And Grow Rich "Updated Edition". So beware of cheap reprints. But honestly speaking, Arthur R Pell has done a fair job with research looking up for newer business moguls, studying their secret to success.

p	Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill was originally written in 1937. This book is a great starting point for anyone interested in financial and personal development. The book stresses that their is no fast way to become successful, it takes hard work. But this book lays out the keys to getting you there. It's based around the principles of the Law of Attraction. The first law is Desire. Create a plan on how you will obtain a certian amount of money by a set date. See yourself already in possession of that amount of money and start the hard work to achieve your dream. The book contains much more and is a great read. I am glad I read this book and would definitely recommend it to others. Thank you for reading my review.
n	I am confused , this is not the original book which i expected to be delievered to me ! book reads that it is based on copy right free version of the title and only uses extracted material . I really don't think this book would be worth a read as it is better to read the book originally published by the author !
n	I have must respect for author. Ok making it two from one. But the book is not very coherent. Think of it like a a theoretical physics book. You won't understand it if nobody have you real life examples. Author talks off too much content. Everybody knows like hard work, dedication, determination. In the end I don't think anybody would be able to remember things from this book or apply them. He has given like 50 points etc. etc. Though at a page or two you have think you can take and even if one learns from this single page it's worth it. But in all it's clunky and just talks of theory, instead if you will read some autobiography where you can follow the life of protagonist you will gain much more.
n	i brought this book one weeks ago i found quality of the paper is very low and font size also very small...this contains duplicate pages..
n	I am giving 1 star not to the Author but the publication house. This books look like a pirated book. Very cheap paper and printing quality.
n	After going through reviews posted on this website I decided to buy this and have a go at it. But I personally think that it is a over hyped book! I regret for buying this book.Whilst reading its getting very bored and the author Is preaching like a typical indian school teachers Whilst they taking lesson in classroom.
p	The router TL-WR841N from TP-Link is just an awesome piece of technology at cheapest rate one can imagine. There are a no. of 300N Wifi routers but compared to the price and reliability it is a winner. I've been using it for the past 3 months and the following are my findings about the router: Pros:- - Good looking & compact router. - Super easy to set up. - Web based utility does a good job in controlling the router. - All required instructions for easy setup are provided. - The Stock firmware has a lot to offer. - DD WRT firmware support (Just Google 'DD WRT' for details). However, I was unable to use the feature as DD WRT firmware for V9 is not available. Also it voids warranty. - Physical Power AND Wi-Fi switch present. Which means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical LAN connection. - 4 LAN ports present. - It can also be used as range extender. - Has 2 non-detachable antennas for boosting Wi-Fi. I've installed the router in 1st floor and get 1-2 bars in ground & 2nd floor and just outside on the road. Also my tab shows 1 bar while on the roof top of my 3 storey building. So, its coverage is good to average. Data/Internet speed has little effect on the available no. of bars. - It can share loads of data via Wi-Fi & LAN network. I had successfully converted my tab into Wi-Fi virtual keyboard, mouse & gamepad/joystick. - Wall mounting can also be done. - 3 Years Replacement Warrenty. Cons:- -Well as such no serious problems have been faced till date. My only concern is its white colour which looks great but is likely to get dirty sooner or later. - Unnecessary heating problem can be avoided by installing it in an open space. Overall it is the cheapest router available in the market at present with loads of feature on offer. It is highly recommended for those who want cheap router with reliability, security & loads of features. UPDATE (1/11/15) :- The router has been working flawlessly for a year and a half now. However, I had to go for replacement twice due to no fault of mine but Act of GOD. The service of TP-Link is great. They replaced my router after testing then and there with no question asked. Though I had to carry it to there service center. Also, I can see the price has come down to half (by '600-'700). Hope this update will help in further decision making.
p	aweseome product. Works like a charm. I have a 3 BHK and it covers the entire apartment and gives a very decent speed throughout. I use it for my ACT fibrenet connection and it works great. Go for it!
p	Purchased after reading a lot of reviews from other buyers for this product. Completely satisfied with the product as per my requirements. My home is a 3 storey building with 2000 sq feet land area. I placed this Router in my 1st floor and it covers each and every corner of the building right from the ground floor to the top of my 2nd floor terrace. Though in some far rooms ( with 3-4 walls in between ) in the ground floor shows single bar but  internet speed is working fine. Its connected with 5 cell phones of my family members, 2 laptops and 5 workstation desktop in my office in 2nd floor. All are working fine with good internet speed. Already using it for more than a month. So I hope future buyers can calculate their requirements. Now about the price:  Purchased at  Rs939/- (Printed MRP on the box Rs2700/- ) on Amazon.in last month 8th July 2015. When ordered from Siliguri, West bengal, I tracked the courier process. From Bangalore it was couriered on the same day and within 2days it was to kolkata and then to Siliguri. But the delivery process from the Siliguri courier office to my home (in the same place) it took 14days. Good Amazon packaging and service .But pathetic Siliguri courier service. Amazon should consult to their delivery partners. They are ruining their reputation.
p	The best router in dual antenna segment ever I have seen
p	I had two routres at my home earlier one being main and the other one as a repeater. Ever since I bought this, I have removed all of them. Only this router which siffices the whole of the house. This is a world winner.
n	It’s been over a week since I am using this product. I am very much inclined to most of the reviewers here. Let me add some points: Background: I was using a rock-solid performer Linksys WRT 54 G for almost a decade and it continues to prove its worth. I was using Airtel broadband 2 mbps plan. I recently moved to ACT fibernet with comparable internet speeds of 42 mbps average (both download and upload). Apparently, my Linksys WRT 54 G could not deliver this speed. It could do a max of 14 mbps :( ... you know its G band after all. In practical terms, G routers can do 15 Mbps vs theoretical 54 Mbps. I wanted to move to N band router (theoretical 300 Mbps) and wanted to touch the waters and I landed up with TP Link WR841N 300Mbps. Following is my feedback: First Impression Out of the Box: Poor plastic grade. However, the fit and finish was adorable despite the poor plastic appearance & feel. Speed - Did I get my anticipated wireless 42 Mbps speed based on my ACT fiber provider? Answer: Yes & No 2 Feet - Full speed 42 Mbps internet. -- Signal Bar: Full 5 5 Feet - 37 Mbps – 5 Bar 10 Feet - 20 Mbps – 5 Bar 15 Feet - 15 Mbps – 5 Bar 20 Feet - 10 Mbps – 4 or 5 Bar 25 Feet - 5 Mbps – 3 or 4 Bar 30 Feet – 3 to 5 Mbps – Almost Dead No walls in between. Tested under line of sight conditions. Tested on free channels with various settings. In a way, this device is like a wife like material. You need to be close enough to get all the attention and at all times (Just kidding, no offence meant). I flashed the DD WRT firmware (with careful instructions) and I played around with all combinations to optimize the experience and there had been no significant change. This means, the hardware has already done its best. We cannot ask a Tiger to run like a Cheetah, can we? :) One important factor: There was not a single dropout or restart and it’s a stable device (tested for a week). Value for Money? In my opinion, I think this device has performed for what I have paid for. Can’t expect more. What Next? For folks who want solid performance (range + speed + multi device + stability) should buy top of the line AC dual band devices offered by various brands like Asus AC 87U etc. But for now they are too too too costly. Just wait and watch the market for the price to drop (maybe a year). Until then this TP Link will faithfully serve you (hopefully). :)
n	TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300Mbps Wireless N Router Good Product, used it before, but I think this seller is not selling the correct product. I had to return the product after replacement as it was defective. People who have bought it already can test this. I am getting a high pitch sound from the router when it is switching on and Wi-Fi gets connected with the default settings. People who are not sensitive of such sound, can test this with your Pet or kids. If your pets gets attentive towards the Router or trying to run from the router(scared) then you also have this problem. This kind of sound used to control pets, which are almost not audible to us, but sensitive to pet. For kids, you can just ask them whether they can hear any sound. Make sure you have a silent room. Awesome router, no doubt, but this seller might not be dealing with correct purchases. I have added a snapshot of the router my friend is using and the router I newly bought. The old router also bought from Amazon, but from a different seller. Hope people who have already bought before me, have non defective piece. Thanks...
n	So all in all let me sum up the router for somebody who doesn't want to go into details. 1) This is a single band wireless N Router. 2) Has descent range but would have loved more. Signal drops significantly because of walls and obstructions. 3) Works well for speed upto 300 Mbps. Lets face it, we in India haven't seen speeds more that 50 Mbps. 4) Installation is pretty easy. You will be able to do it yourself. 5) Is not an ADSL router, so will work with service providers which give internet through LAN cable. Does what it is supposed to do pretty well. Would have loved  to have better coverage. Overall great deal for the price. Can't really go wrong with purchase. Another option to consider is a Dual band Router. A little expensive but might be help full for some people. Now lets get to the pros and cons of a Dual band router and let me try and explain to you how it works and in which case you should get one. Lets start with the dual band thing. So you might be tempted to think a router has excellent range after all it has 3 antennas. 5dBi as the companies try and tell you should be very strong. But you will be disappointed with the results. The router has 2 antennas for the 2.4 GHz signal and one for the 5 GHz signal which will show as a different Wi-Fi signal. Let me try and explain to you why you might need dual band signal. You have signal broadcasted at different frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in a dual band router. All the Wi-fi routers have signals broadcasted at 2.4 GHz and having too many routers in a small space makes it difficult to have a good connection and the signals from your router can interfere with signal from a nearby router. So if you are staying in a apartment with many Wi-Fi signals near you, having a the options to switch to 5GHz is a great one to have. But the coverage area for the 5 GHz signal is limited as only one antenna is dedicated for the 5 GHz signal. One more thing many of us might now know is that the 2.4 GHz signal and the 5 GHz signal show us as separate Wi-Fi signals. So if you move away from the router you will have to switch from one Wi-Fi signal to the other.
n	WARNING: BUYERS BEWARE! Buyers need to be aware that the reviews that you are reading here are for different routers! There are actually SIX different models (as of 2015), in India, of this "same" router - TL-WR841N version 1, TL-WR841N version 7, TL-WR841N version 8, TL-WR841N version 9, TL-WR841N version 10 and TL-WR841N version 11.  And with each "version", TP-LINK has changed the hardware of this router. Naturally, with different hardware, the performance of the router vary a lot. Some of the reviews here are for "version 8" and below, while some are for "version 9" and above. That may explain the discrepancy in the reviews (for example, some have complained that the wifi coverage is "average", while others have said it is "good" or "excellent"). OpenWRT page on this router has a table comparing the hardware - http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd PLEASE COMPLAIN TO AMAZON.COM ABOUT THIS and request them to ensure that seller also includes the "version" in the model number, and creates separate product page for each version so that the reviews are accurate and do not mislead us customers. --- I bought another one of this router to extend my WiFi. Unfortunately, though the router supports WDS bridging it did not work. That's when I discovered that the two TL-WR841N routers I had purchased were not the same! (TP-Link themselves say that WDS bridging with different router models, from even the same company, may not work).  Last year (2014), when I had purchased this router I had got the "version 9" model and this year (2015) I received the "version 10" model. It was irritating - to ensure that I could use both routers and extend my WiFi, I then had to install a beta version of DD-WRT on my older "version 9" model, and use my mediocre router hacking skills to make everything work. ---- (My first review of the older, "version 9" model is below  ...) I had some concerns about buying a cheap modem from a Chinese company. But TP-Link seems to be a multi-national corporation and one of the top 10 players in this field. So I figured I'd take the risk. Bought and received a factory sealed, brand new item from the seller. The parcel packaging was good and the item was undamaged and worked fine as soon it was plugged in. The month and year of import was listed as "July 2014" for the item I received. For those who want to install DD-WRT please note that I received a "Version 9" model of this router, and not "Version: 8" as listed in the Amazon.com description for this router's page. Since I didn't wish to void the warranty by installing custom firmware anyway, it didn't matter to me (the TL-WR841N comes with a 3 years replacement warranty, which is great considering its price). The stock firmware offers a good enough set of options and is easily accessible through a web based interface you can use with any modern browser. The range is decent, but nothing extraordinary. My previous Linksys ADSL modem had a weak signal and thus occasionally dropped connections in the first floor. The signal on the first floor above is still weak, but the wifi connections seem more stable  with this modem. Overall, happy so far. Will update this feedback, with additional information on this routers performance, after a few months. Update: It's been 9+ months on now since I purchased this router. Since the purchase, TP - Link has released 2-3 firmware updates, and I was safely able to upgrade the router without any issues each time. Performance of the router remains satisfactory. Using it both through wifi and LAN cable, and network connection is stable and good on both. Sometimes it is on for days but it doesn't heat up much at all. CORRECTION I had earlier mentioned that I faced network connections issues while torrenting, and suspected it could be because the TP-Link router couldn't handle the number of connections that torrenting sometimes require. I may have been wrong about this as I forgot that the connection to the internet is actually provided by the ISP's modem - router, which is connected to my TP-Link device. As such, further investigation is required to check which device is actually causing the issue.
n	Range is pretty good but i ordered for black and got white
p	The actors are excellent. Bring back old memories of my own childhood with my friends. Swami is really really fun. God, what a fun time it would have been.
p	We can't live our life again but we can feel and memorize the past. Watching these stories made me happy, specially "Vendor of Sweets" and "Swami and Friends". Everyone should buy this complete set of Malgudi Days. Never miss it!
p	Brings back nostalgic feeling watching these TV adaptions of R.K.Narayan’s novels & short stories. Shankar Nag’s recreation of Malgudi and direction is amazing. In today’s clutter of empty, long running television serials, a lighthouse which proves that television is a medium for fine arts in the hands of a great director telling the amazing stories of a phenomenal storyteller.
p	Well I received my DVD set and it's ok. But what shocked me is that here they are showing the cover of Reliance Music etc and the seller Pritam Music Pvt Ltd sent me the DVD set produced by Ultra DVD Video !! I didn't return it because it's episodes were ok and quality too. I gave five stars because I love Malgudi Days. My favourite Indian English author is R.K.Narayan.
p	I went back to my childhood days. Thanks for delivering this masterpiece. Shankar Nag's master piece and Swami's innocence takes us back to olden days. Dr.Ramanujam Venugopalan Bangalore
n	Poor product. Not all cd's working properly. Episodes bring back old memories though.
n	I don't know HIndi and I bought this in hurry since I love these stories from my childhood.  I agree it's my mistake overlooking the product page. However it would be much helpful (particularly in country like India) if you could have mentioned the the language in the Heading itself.  Something like  Malgudi Days - HINDI - 18 VCD Premium Pack (1987) Anyways, I gifted it to one of my friend at Noida.
n	DVD-3 IS DEFECTIVE.very bad experince loss of money
n	Some CDs play well, some bad and some very bad.
n	Most of the DVDs did not work
p	Bought it a month ago, almost used every 2nd day, here's the review. Backup and Charging: 1) Charging Time: 8-10hrs, may increase with time with normal wear and tear as with every product. a) Runs for 30-35 Minutes, even more, on a single charge, One charge is basically enough for 10days! 2) Trimming, Styling hardly takes 2-3minutes, So one charge is more than sufficient for your needs, Hence, battery backup should not be an issue, charge once a week, and it will go fine for years. 3) All those saying it isn't corded, It's for your own good, Imagine the risk of getting an electric shock while trimming your beard, You won't want that, Right?? And you will also not run it for whole 35-40 minutes at one go. Maximum 5 minutes is what you'll run it, hence, backup is more then Enough. Performance: 1) Product performs flawless, cuts hairs smoothly, no matter how long your beard has grown. I've been using Philips Shaver too, and even after 3 years, it runs as good a it was for 1st day. Although, used moderately. So blades should not be in doubt. 2) Yes, No Oiling needed. 3) Washable blades, Easily removable and cleanable, However, I didn't find usage of washing it, a blow of air is enough to clean it. 4) Less vibrations and moderate sound. Comfortable for user. Accessories Supplied: Comb: Not the comb you use for your hairs! It fits with the trimmer, and adjust for various lengths, ideal for styling mustache, french cut etc. Quality is good. Handle with care though. Brush: To clean those tiny little hairs on the device. Charger: You can either charge or either use it, No Charging while using it, Light will glow on Charger, but it won't go out, even if it's charged. Few Leaflets, and Yes, Register it on Philips to get an extra year of warranty. The backside of trimmer will have a 4 digit number, above model number, that's your serial number, still having issues? Call Customer Care. Overall Review: product's great! Amazon's price is comparatively cheaper with all, flipkart too, delivery was within 2 days, without any additional delivery scheme asked for. Delivery Guy was very professional, and packaging was rock solid! Go for it, it's more than enough for all your trimming needs.
p	This is a nice trimmer. It has a Good Battery life, but require long time for charging.This gives a precision trimming.
p	Due to its brilliant design, trimming was never so easy before. Light weight, good looks, battery backup is also good and at a very reasonable price. So, guys don't think so much just go for it. I am using it and very satisfied.
p	Perfect Delivery, Original Prdoduct, working good,  extended warranty by registering in philips(to register take a snap on invoice of amazon attached to packed box ), thank you amazon...i have Satisfied
p	For the price, it is the best trimmer available in the market. Very smooth and fast. Near shaving experience .
n	all of a sudden the trimmer stopped working with 10 mins even after charging for whole night and I had do shaving :( Then again I had put for charging and check it didn't work at all..
n	Continuosly it is getting stucked in the middle... Now it is completely stopped working. Where to get it repaired. Please suggest.
n	Pathetic product. The brand has used a lot of clever advertising on TV for this product - bought it, poor plastic casing, bad blades, does not cut fine hair. The adjustment trimmer on top is really bad ... even on setting 3 it cuts very close ... and now the device does not charge. Works only when plugged into the socket else goes off. Overall a very poor experience, pathetic product.
n	Very nice trimmer. Please read below the pros and cons: Pros: Can be used for Haircut, (Clipper over comb) Hair trimming over the ears, nape and back of head for short cuts One can go from long hair to soldier-cut in a few minutes at home, however the battery lasts long enough. Beard trimming is not that great as even at zero (without the plastic guard) beard hair still looks so grown up. Very useful for trimming body hair - chest, underarms and any unwanted hair. Can trim pubic hair, but only if the skin is stretched properly and with guard atleast at 2-3mm. Cons: This product should have had a speed control, as sometimes when it is fully charged, it runs like wool trimmer - very dangerous if care is not taken, it can cut/nick the skin. Always stretch the skin while trimming Size could have been smaller allowing it to be more portable and easy to carry and easy to use. If you trim somewhat grown out beard, then the surroundings like basin and mirror will easily showered with hair which makes a messy cleanup job. The blade is not that safe as it is advertised. If due care is not taken, it can give occasional small cuts in skin very easily
n	very bad !! after 15 days charger not working !!!
p	Using for last 4 months and really comfortable and good looking really stunning.
p	Very good looking and comfortable
p	Comfrt Good looking
p	Excellent one
p	It's small and works really well. Had to use the CD to install the drivers (comes with the device). The signal drops significantly as the distance from router grows. It's good for smaller homes though. Also, it does not catch the signals from my neighbours, which would generally show on my laptops built-in wi-fi mechanism.
p	After using it for a couple of weeks i am giving this feedback. In fact, it is really a good product . I faced no problem connecting with other wifi devices. I am so impressed with the product that i ended up buying two more for my friends! The only issue with this is coverage area. Considering the fact that it's a portable device, one should not expect more.
p	Received the product before time...Happy with the service of Amazon. The device is perfect...No need to purchase an Ethernet Card or any router it does its work as expected both receives the Wi-Fi Signals and transmits the signals from PC connected with a Wired LAN Connection...Only thing is we have to enter the IP address most of the times and some times the signal drops(rarely).
p	I removed the old PCI card and put this USB *dongle* and it did not ask for any drivers but a reboot was enough (I am using Ubuntu). I feel that the sensitivity is a bit less but that can be due to so many other reasons... I like this one because on the older wifi cards, the antenna kept on getting broken. This is far more robust. I gave four stars only because I felt that the sensitivity may be a bit less (compared to *others*). In short, strongly recommended! This one is really plug and forget.
p	i have purchased for my PC which doesn't have wireless network. i have router at my office and main advantage of this product is you don't have to  do anything, just insert the CD and plug and play this. special advantage of this product is that it savings your money who will do wiring from router to PC and its so much hectic like if you have concealed wiring then you cant do anything or if you have wired LAN and you want to change the place of your PC then you cant do that. such a great and compact product
n	The product was not working properly and just did not transmit signals . I gave a negative feedback and was promised my product will be replaced and hence I converted my negative feedback to positive , The behavior changed instantly from VEEDEE enterprises . The lady executive Shashi did not reply to my mails and  despite calling 5 times once i was near their office location just did not bother to tell me the complete address even once !!  which was very troublesome as I kept roaming from one location to the other . The mail address they have put is incomplete . The device did not work there . Disastrously She went to the extent of telling me that I came in to spoil her Saturday - Extremely uncourteous behavior with a customer . However The owner Mr Devesh Tanna  is a Kind gentleman and replaced the dongle instantly. I will certainly never buy anything from veedee if this is the kind of behavior shown once the feedback is changed . would you pay for a Non working device and sit for two months till the product team even bothers to sent an update ? and behave in this way ? No responses No mails once the feedback is changed from Negative to positive A harrowing experience for the first time from Amazon .
n	I would not recommend this product to anybody as this one has many problems. First it does't get recognized by windows7 by itself, you need install its drivers which comes with the CD and the application interface given in this CD is pathetic seems like old Win98 Application. Then comes to connection, this device connects right away when you start it but disconnects after some time and this keeps on happening. This is not because of improper configuration, its due to signal drop from the device. I tried many methods to keep it going but it does't. Rather than going for this I would suggest to go for better brands like Linksys, TPLink, Belkin, NetGear or D-Link which bit more expensive than this. There are some basic models in these brands which are not much expensive which can be used for Home purpose.
n	Its not working at least 30 days
n	While this device connects to internet effortlessly, the connection speed is very slow. You just might have an internet connection for namesake. Forget about streaming videos or even audio for that matter. The transfer speeds were equivalent to a decade back dial up connection. I am not even referring to internet connection where the issue might be with my connection. I have actually measured the data transfer speeds by moving files within network and it moves at dial up connection speeds.
n	Doesn't work properly if router is in another room. Week signal strength and signal quality. May be its suitable for single room setup only. Problem is due to small size and internal antenna.

p	Superb headset with amazing bass:-)
p	i ordered the product on 2 mar and was delivered to me on 4 mar. thanks for the fast delivery amazon. talking about headset, they are just awesome. best product in such a low price. noise reduction is really awesome. i also compared them with a set of apple headset which you get with iphone and also with skulcandy. i am totally satisfied with my choice. Many are talking about that there is no warranty for online purchases of these headsets. yes you dont get warranty for online purchases of jbl products . But i would like to tell you that if you purchase these from FX AUDIO ( i.e.Sahil international) (official dealer for jbl in india) which is a dealer on amazon you get the warranty on showing the bill which you get with the delivery box. I have confirmed these things by calling Sahil international. so go for it !!
p	Here's my honest review on these cool pairs of earphones. Price:- I got it for Rs. 699 which is a great price for a big brand with the brand's signature sound. So I'd say that it's one of the best budget earphones out there. Quality:- The physical quality of the earbuds is great. The wire quality isn't the best but definitely not cheap. Truthfully, I use all my earphones roughly and these earphones survived ;). The wire doesn't tangle very easily but it does tangle. It does get bent easily but it doesn't affect the wire or the sound. Design:- It's a really simple design but they do look beautiful. Sound:- Honestly, these are the best earphones I've ever used and I've used Senheiser CX175, CX180 Street 2 (pretty promising),Skullcandy Riff, Ink'd 2 and Audio Technica C2X5 (expensive ones) and a lot more provided by phone manufacturers The soundstage is perfect. Truthfully, I love bass but I'm not a basshead, I only like bass where it's needed, provided that it's in adequate amount (that is what purebass means :/) AND these earphones DELIVERED. And I don't like it when the bass is overpowering i.e. compromises sound quality, but again, T150A delivered. The treble is good and apparent by which I mean the bass doesn't exercise veto power over it. The lows, mids and highs are all great, thanks to JBL's signature sound. The sound is natural with a punch of bass, what I mean is that it is the whole package, what with a mic and a button for answering/ending calls and playing/pausing music. Comfort:- Really comfortable and snuggly. They fit in the ear perfectly. Delivery:- Amazon was prompt I got these headphones before the estimated delivery date. (2 working days) Believe me I spent weeks searching for the best budget earphones, all pointed towards Senheiser CX180 Street 2 so I took them, but I didn't like them, the sound stage wasn't quite as good, not to mention the absence of a mic and the button also the shape of the plug is well, a bit irritating when the earphones are used. So I went for these and I'm really happy with my choice. I recommend it to anyone who wants earphones and is under a budget. I hope you read the review and buy these. My actual rating is 4.5 (wire quality and I want to act like a critic 😛) but since there is no option for it..........
p	After 50+ hrs of burning. Pros: 1. Awesome sound quality and brilliant bass. Better than what I expected 2. Product looks and feels genuine & sturdy 3. Has a nice mic which work perfectly while making calls. 4. Sheer value for money, I got this headset in Rs. 649 through deal. Couldn't ask for more. Cons: 1. Length of cable is little less, you may find it short if you are a tall person or prefer to keep phone away while listening to music. 2. Cable is sensitive to bruising, it may disturb if you are moving or eating something while listening. 3. Sometimes you may find that bass is getting faded specially if the song in bass boosted. If you are low on budget and looking for a decent headset go for it.
p	First time used JBL headphones. JBL says "Hear the Truth." and they deserve for "Hear the Truth." Here are Pros and Cons Pros : BASS(10/10) : People generally worry about headphone's Bass. But Believe me JBL will not disappoint you. Really POWERFUL BASS and moreover have extremely good quality. Clarity( 9/10 ) Sound Clarity : Sound clarity also depend on your mobile or laptop or other device. But as far as JBL's concern, It gives really good sound clarity to you. Cons : Feels like common headphones. But still JBL wins because of extremely good quality sound. Last words. You will not get Better than this under 800. Go for it blindly.. to "Hear the truth"
n	Well, the product quality is fine. It has good clarity and loudness. But here are a few points worth noting before buying it: 1. The bass response leaves a lot to be desired. I have done all possible tinkering with the equalizers and finally got a passable level. Still, its way below what one can call good bass. 2. The bud-casing is round and small making them difficult to grip while removing or placing on ear. 3. The wires seem a bit flimsy but no issues so far. 4. When using the mic, the noise reduction and clarity of speech is excellent. 5. Product is original with good packaging. 6. The length of the wire is just sufficient for most purposes.
n	pretty average just about worth the 650 rs i paid for it..... whats always good is that having a mic lets u make calls... have to say though that in this price range sound magic is still pretty amazing.. having the jack come out straight is an added disapointment as they dont last that long.... anyway will see how it goes this is my second jbl buy the first was a huge fail a jbl GO blutooth speaker lasted a month!!! the build quality seems pretty cheap its clear tht they are manufacturing this at nothing actual price should be a hundred rs okie should u buy it? well if you dont trust chinese brands like sound magic yes but please dont buy at more than 700 :)
n	I bought this earphones 6 months back.. And from last 2 months I face problems like right side is not working some times or if it works than compare to left side it works slower or voice is starched and it irritates so much . so I contact jbl costemer care in my city Ahmadabad .they say "u have to contact Mumbai branch for solution if u bought it from any local shop than we can slove your problem or u have to deal with it by your self n courier it to Mumbai for replacement . if it is a jbl product y should I have to send it to Mumbai????? Y don't u guys can give replacement in customer care located in my city????
n	I will give u 3/5 Bcoz its a thin wire and get messy. It takes minutes to complete it out with this **cking wire and solve it. It sucks everytime and nobody likes that and 2nd reason is its not that good i mean its build quality is ok ok or less than ok ok. Its not , i m using this stuff from 2 months and its wire is get looser from mic . And coming out from the joint. U dont believe me i apply FAVIQUICK On it, now its fine but now my earphones button is not working its jam bcoz of FAVIQUICK Y I M GIVING 3 STAR FOR THIS BCOZ I GOT THIS IN 599/-RS AND ITS SOUND CLEARITY AND BASE IS GOOD VERY GOOD
n	I have been using this for around 4 months now. Bought it for Rs. 650/- from amazon itself, seemed very good value for money at this price range. These are decent pair for listening music with awesome noise cancellation, bass seems OK not good not bad either. It also has microphone with button to pick up call, I used it regularly and did not faced any issue during calls. Note : I don't think there is any option to disconnects call after you are over with talking, you have wait for other person on other end to disconnect the call. Quality of headphone is good in terms of material used.
p	This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015.  Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device.  This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you. It's broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits.  If you’re in a hurry I’ve included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end. Summary - What can you do with it? ----------------------------------------- * Read a book.  It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday. * Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection * Borrow a book.  Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books  (if you have Amazon Prime Membership) * Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family * Highlight a section.  Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines.  If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated. * Record a bookmark.  To come back to it later * Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position * Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder * Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the “X Ray” feature. * Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks * Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or "family sharing") * Access every book you've ever owned "on the cloud" - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G.. What Devices are available? -------------------------------- As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:- 1. Kindle 6" 2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) 2. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) 3. Kindle Voyger 4. Kindle Fire - 6" or 7" colour tablet computers at around So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options.  Which to buy?  Here's a quick summary in order of cost. *** The entry level Kindle *** An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks. A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender.  For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display.  Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours. *** New Kindle Paperwhite *** Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage.  The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the “original Paperwhite” to 6 weeks - but still a very long time. Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means it’s faster and slicker than before, and a new “Bookerly” font plus better presentation of fonts on screen. If you have an existing Paperwhite it’s probably not worth upgrading.  However, if you own a prior device, you’ll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance. *** The Voyage *** Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter.  It has more of a “quality” feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps direct from getting caught in the edges.  The back has a “soft touch” plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new “Page Press” buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed there’s a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch).  It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge. Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions.  This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesn’t look too bright.  In addition, you’ll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness.  To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device. *** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer *** The "Kindle Fire” range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range.  Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks.  Although you can read books on a “Fire” using the Amazon Kindle App, you’ll find the Kindle with it’s sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book.  You’ll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated “book reader” device. Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep.  The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it won’t for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark. Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while it’s fine for everyday use, it’s less useful on holiday.  The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight. What other options do I have? ---------------------------------- Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:- * Special Offers - ie. adverts * 3G or WIFI connection Personally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle.  They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting. The 3G option is a more difficult question.  This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books “over-the-air” instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot.  Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but it’s a personal choice.  Of course if you won’t have WIFI at home, then you’ll need the 3G option. One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a “Personal Hotspot” or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to.  Got to Settings —> Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while you’re out and about. Conclusion ------------- If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option.  You’ll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but you’ll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite. The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen.  Finally, there’s the top of the range Voyage with the “page press” buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness. If you’re in the market for a “Tablet Computer” then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but you’ll get a better “book reading” experience on the Kindle.  Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2.  I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus. Frequently Asked Questions? --------------------------------- Q:  What file format will a Kindle read? A:  Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion Q:  What?  It doesn’t support EPUB format? A:  No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called “Calibre”.  Simple search for “You Tube um0teoAR6zw” and you’ll see a video explaining how to do this.  Simples. Q:  If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as well? A:  No.  All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device. Q:  Can I save my place in the book? A:  Yes.  It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position. Q:  I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font size? A:  Yes.  There’s a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastes Q:  Can I share books with my partner or children? A:  Yes.  You can now share your books using "Amazon Family Library" to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family Q. Can I use a Kindle to read in bed? A. Yes.  But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models.  It’s a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light.  For the base Kindle model you’ll need the light on Q. Are there any free books available? A. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded.  If you have a “Amazon Prime” membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books. Q:  How long does the battery last? A:  Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day.  I’ve certainly found I’ve gone for weeks without charging the device Q:  How long does it take to charge? A:  From absolutely flat, around 4 hours Q:  How many books will the Kindle hold? A:  Literally thousands.  You can also download every book you’ve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited. Q:  Do I need anything else? A:  You’ll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesn’t come with a charger (but the Fire does).  Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it.  Some people also buy a “cover”, but I think this is not really needed.  It adds to the weight, and is not really needed.  It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if it’s left knocking around in a bag.
p	I pre-booked the Kindle on 28th. It was shipped on 29th and it arrived on July 1st. This is the Second e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought.I have loved and used my Kindle Touch for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark.Then came the original Paperwhite, with its small size, sharper screen and front-lighting. The 2015 Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the 2015 Paperwhite. If you have the original Kindle, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the 2015 Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 Paperwhite. I purchased a Kindle Touch and I also use a Nexus 7 Tablet but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this 2015 model was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new Kindle. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text. 2015 Paperwhite Vs, Kindle Voyage The Voyage gives you improved contrast, quasi-button zones for turning pages, an adaptive backlight, and 12 percent less weight than other Kindles, but I don’t really think those things add up to being worth the extra cost. While the Kindle Voyage remains Amazon's high-end ebook reader, you simply can't beat the Paperwhite for sheer value. The Paperwhite is a fantastic value for the price. Pros Affordable, priced same as old Paper-white and 5,000 INR less than Kindle Voyage.. Sharp, bright screen. Improved performance. Excellent interface. Cloud-based storage. Vast ebook store. Cons No adaptive back-light, waterproofing, or audiobook support. Bottom Line Thanks to a sharper display, faster performance, and the same affordable price, Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhite is the best ebook reader you can buy.
p	It took me months to decide whether i should buy a gadget for 11000 to read books. Took the decision exactly during the launch of this new kindle. And i am extremely happy with this decision. Its been two days. So cant comment about the battery life. Feel and look are great. Compared it with an actual paperback. I was worried before about the rendering of pdfs when i read the reviews of prev gen kindle. Thanks to Calibre i could easily convert the pdfs into kindle format and it is perfect. The only con is the flicker when we turn the page. Just a small con. POOR Packaging: Reduced one star for packaging. Product was delivered by Aramex logistics. It was just covered by a simple cardboard just like a book cover. Not even a single layer of Bubble wrap for this 11,000 Gadget?? why?? UPDATE :After using it for more than 4 months, Battery Backup: Battery backup is good. Most of the times i keep the screen on for 1 or 2 hrs, though i don't read the book continuously. For such use, battery backup is one month approximately. i.e i have charged my kindle only 4 or 5 times. Eye strain: No eye strain while reading it in day time. But a very slight(negligible) strain can be experienced when reading in night time. That strain is not much. Not like the smartphone screen. But since it is after all a digital screen, you will feel that. BEST PRO : Reading time has increased. Mobile usage has decreased.
p	I am sitting on a train at New Delhi and a foreigner dressed as a Sadhu is going around and offers spiritual books to read. I politely turn him down and return to reading from my Kindle. He then goes on to berate the stupidity of reading on electronic devices and predicts that pretty soon we would even get food from a computer screen. I smile at him again and return to my book. The Kindle is a smart little device that does one thing, and one thing well. But do you need it?? Well here are some Pros: 1. It is light. Crazy light when you consider it can hold thousands of books. 2. I am interested in philosophical books, historical treatises and old books in general and you can find books by Dante, Aristotle, Einstein, Shakespeare for free online!! Talk about a free lunch!! 3. It is distraction free 4. It will be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. For ye non LOTR people, it has incredible battery life. 5. You can buy, review, recommend, browse books from this one device, provided you have a Wifi or 3G connection 6. I have always lamented switching on a light for reading, cause it seems like a waste of electricity considering how long i read and most of the time the lighting is not ideal, but with the Paperwhite all I need is a comfortable corner to sit in and I am set for the rest of the year. 7. It is so convenient when you want to quickly pick up a book and start reading. I carry my Kindle like most people carry their iPads and I set to reading when I feel like I will have to wait for a long while (which is a lot in India)!! 8. You can get the newspaper or magazines directly to your Kindle for free (ahem ahem) if you use Calibre. However I gave up on this as I had an error once too often. 9. Get a case, you will love the personality it can add. I personally got the Amazon Genuine Leather case from the US and it is awesome. You cant get that case here though. But the case just protects the screen and overall device at all times. My Kindle fell from the top berth in a train while I slept. I woke up in the middle of the night and found it on the floor on top of some shoes. So while it didnt suffer much impact I am sure the screen would have been scratched had I not had the case on. Cons: 1. It is just not a real book. I still prefer the feel and smell of a physical book. This doesnt even come close but I have never found reading this easy. Now I always have a book close by and can read under any light. I like physical books but right now I have no idea when I will be required to shift to a new city or will have to travel but now I dont need a carton of books each time I travel. So is it for everyone? No!! If you want to read like crazy, if you prefer reading to the TV show playing next door, if you can zone out and read in public, if you need your literary fix so much so that people suggest you go to rehab, this device is for you. For everyone else, its your money and your choice.
p	If you travel a lot and want to spend your this time in reading, then it is a recommended device otherwise books are always better when you are at home. You have to convert PDF files into kindle format before reading it on kindle. PDF versions are not as good as kindle version. Some pictures will be lost in this process of conversion from PDF to kindle format. Please be aware that there is no service centre, meaning your device won't be repaired if you break it accidentally even in warranty period.
n	I paid Rs.14000 for kindle paperwhite with 3G+wifi. It's exactly 18 months and the screen has frozen. Support says they can't help. So Rs.14000 down the drain in only one and a half years. What is amazing is that there is no service center in India ! How can a company sell such a costly product and have no service center? As long as it worked, the product was wonderful. But having to throw away a Rs.14000 product after only 18 months is very painful. The customer service executive has given me a gift voucher of Rs.1000 as a consolation, perhaps? So, a great product (as long as it works) but horrible service.
n	On the first day of my purchase i found there were darkness at the bottom of the screen where led's are placed. The light or the color of the screen when full bright was not uniform.
n	Very bad experience with this model of kindle. The same has been replaced three times and all three devices have some defects. Most common distraction point were two pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen. So if i differentiate defects by devices that has been replaced by amazon they goes like this: Device 1: Two pitch black spots at the bottom of the  screen. Device 2: Three pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen + Pale Yellowish dull display. Device 3: Two pitch black spots at the bottom of the screen + Light leakage at two points on both the sides of the display. So in a nutshell not at all a good experience while reading on this product, the previous generation has no such glitches and i would rather advice to go for previous generation model or wait for a while and not to go for the June, 2015 batch of the same product has to my experience that batch is having some serious manufacturing  defects. Apart from the product, i do really appreciate the customer service and refund/replacement policies of amazon.
n	This is the first e-reader i have ever owned and earlier to this i relied on dead trees for my reading,  so I had no idea what to expect from a kindle. Now i have been using the New kindle paperwhite since a month and it's been a positive experience (mostly). First the hardware: Kindle has an excellent e-ink display at a resolution of 1440*1080p backed with an excellent built in light allowing you to read under almost any front size and light conditions. This solves my first major problem while reading an actual book(can't read it with lights off). The build quality is very good, with the power button and charging port at the bottom. But i feel that the power button would be better on top or back(like voyager) instead of bottom because it might be uncomfortable for some while reading in Landscape mode. The battery backup was good, it lasted long enough to read 2 books (about 6000 loc each) but it might vary according to your reading speed and brightness settings. Now the Software (where problem starts): It has 2  built in English dictionary and many more from other languages on cloud to download if required. Dictionary and the word wise (later is only for books bought on amazon)are 2 features which brings smart reading experience to kindle. But as mentioned my experience with software was not very pleasant and in no particular order here are some problems i came across. 1) Landscape mode is restricted to only one side, which would not be a problem if bezels on top and bottom were symmetrical, but they aren't,  hence causing a problem mostly for right handed people. 2) Drm free books can only be read from documents folder from storage (it took me 20 mins to figure out the problem). 3)Amazon pulling the plug on active content and games support from this generation of kindles. 4)No support for epub 5)Cannot take written notes or create simple text documents, which comes in very handy. 6)Browser doesn't not have multiple tabs. 7)horrible scaling for pdf(seriously don't buy kindle as a device for reading pdf,  it sucks). 8)Amazon won't allow you to share your book for more than once, and that too only for 14 days (which is total bs btw). and many more so on. So amazon if you are reading this plz look in to the problems. Finally the conclusion: For me though the feel of reading actual book is still superior to a kindle, but smart reading experience provided by kindle with features like dictionary x-ray and word wise along with in buit light makes me never go back to read a normal book. And since majority of my problem with kindle are software related (i think so) and can be fixed with an update (if amazon are willing to fix them). I can and will strongly recommend kindle to anybody who wants a smarter and good reading experience with very little comprises. PS: The packaging seemed good from outside but shocked to see that there was NO BUBBLE WRAP or anything else (just a cardboard wrapped around the actual box). It costs 11000 and you can't even ensure proper packing, did not expect this from cloudtail. PPS: Removed 2 stars because i had to replace my kindle due to black spots at the bottom of screen and the screen looks pale yellowish on the new one(look out for defective ones).
n	While the kindle itself is a good e reader, there appears to be a complete lack of quality control on these devices. Im currently on my 4th kindle. The first had a non functional touch screen, which was promptly replaced. The second had a terrible uneven backlight with atleast 20% of the screen darker than the rest. The third had what appeared to be specks of dust trapped within the display which glowed extremely bright whenever the backlight was turned on. The kindle that i currently use still does not have a completely even screen, however with the backlight turned down, its slightly less noticeable. I am however not going to return this one, as it would appear that receiving a kindle without issues is next to impossible, and i would run the risk of receiving one that has even worse screen issues. Unlike a television where screen issues are typically obscured by the movement of images on the screen,on an e-reader, where one would spend hours looking at what amounts to fairly static images/pages, these flaws are even more glaring. Honestly, i would have expected far more from amazon, and am appalled by the poor quality of the overall product, especially when one takes into account that this is by no means cheap. Kudos however to amazon customer care, who have been courteous, and willing to deal with multiple returns/replacements.
p	1.Well the delay in writing this reviw is coz i wanted to test it an see the product.also i wanted to write the feed back using the laser keyboard itself. 2.  The keyboard is a chinese  product no doubt but it works like majic indeed. The sensitivity is is pretty good and one gets the feel of a normal key board. Also it has the multi function keys;which is to say that if u press shift key and type the letters then the capital letters get printed.thus the device is actually detecting multiple keys at the same time. 3.  A feature shown in one of the videos was that the device can also be used as a mouse pointer and to scroll pages but this did not work in case of zook. I paired it with two  of my phones one by one and it worked well. 4.  The restriction is that the device needs a plane hard surface to project and detect the images. U cant just spread a hanky and start typing on ur glass table.this is a little restricting.although it wud have been the best if the keyboard coud be projected on any surface whatsoever(ie even curved and serrated such as a bed sheet) and be able to type. 5.  The battery backup in one flow is a thing i am yet to check on but i guess it shud be pretty neat for the sock and awe type of occassions where this device intially will be most used. 6.  Do keep ur user manual safe coz i lost mine and now i dont knw how to swith of the beep feedback in device and save battery.since the device is very new no online manual or videos on youtube exist to assist u. Enjoy ur devices.its a great buy.
p	kindly advise how to use the mouse key on laptop!
p	Its nice but the price is way to high. Not that comfortable to use yet. I'll suggest to wait for sometime till the advamced model is launched and definitely the price go down.
p	Excellent
p	Best keyboard i hv used....
n	The actual product is quite different from what was seen in the pic.  Quality of the keyboard projection and blue tooth connectivity was poor.  I had to eventually return the product.
p	Superb n software also work but only red color no other color work
p	EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND DELIVERY
p	Very Good
n	I'm unable to edit/customize as it says. The font and letters look blurred no matter what different ways you try to customize. The ones which already comes in the usb Looks good and clear. Pretty disappointed.
n	The product is amazing. Worked for the first two days. After I custom made the messages, it stopped showing messages. Will show only the 1st message. Then resets to the beginning of the 1st msg. Doesnt show the other msgs.
n	Cannot edit text . Even after editing three lines appear . Not worth it if you are wanting to edit and display some text .
n	So bad not used even once such a hopeless product. Such a fraud product. No light. In it just fan
n	I m getting an error while downloading profram. Failed to write a data . Pls help
p	nice led in this range picture quality is great but some problem facing of connectivity with USB port wall mount not delivered with this product guys installation and setup is very easy so don't waste your 2000 rs to 3000 rs on LG guy for installation and wall mount. for wall mount u can purchase separately from amazon in 450 rs and spend 100 rs on local guy for wall mounting my 10th class brother had installed this easily .
p	It's a great TV, though a few things must be kept in mind: 1) Apparently, buying the same TV offline will give you a 2 year warranty instead of one, and installation, demo, and the bracket (which cost me ~1300) will be free. 2)The TV does NOT have 3 USB and 3 HDMI ports. It actually has 1 USB and 2 HDMI ports. Apart from this, great TV. Plays movies off USB flawlessly. Remote feels a bit cheap in the hand, though.
p	Purchased this TV on Oct 2015. Working fine so far. Worth for the money. Pros:(rating out of 5) Bigger size - 4 Picture quality - 3 Sound quality - 3 Connectivity - 3 Warranty & support - 2 Cons: Limited connectivity - Doesn't have port to connect 5.1 output For advanced users, WiFi not available and hence they need to go for a coslty one Sound quality could have been improved. 10W speakers couldn't provide that much intensity in audio. You need to go to 30-40 pts to hear the audio properly in large hall. They missed the wall mount bracket. I asked for compensation and Amazon agreed to pay the price of the Bracket bought offline from a store.
p	Excellent TV .purchased from snap deal for offer price. Go for it. With out second thoughts. 43 inch. Very big TV. Awesome clarity. Try playing HD high bit rate videos. Its like theater. Picture quality is awesome. Audio good. U can get 100% picture quality unless you have HD set of box with HD connection. And HD videos. Pictures quality is too good. Very good beautifully designed TV. Excellent TV. Go for it.
p	This is the first time I ordered a TV online the delivery was very prompt hats off to Amazon About the TV it looks very elegant in my living room. It is a basic TV with no frills completely worth the price I paid which was 36k and the pic quality is soothing
n	Dont buy LG tv. my TV display is not working. raised complaint with LG support. still now issue is not resolved. utter waste suport form LG. so pleasse dont buy LG tv. my complaint no:- RNA151231087190 utter waste service. totally frustrated with LG support.
n	Disappointed by the price which is offered by AMAZON, they have removed the bracket and installation , i had to pay Rs .5300/- extra for the flexi bracket and installation. The TV packagin clearly shows that a FLEXI bracket is included inspite of that i had to  pay extra. AMZON is taking us fo ra ride by quoting a low price.
n	I have already confirm with LG on call about bracket in the order but still it does not include Flexi Wall Mount Bracket when delivered. Now i have to buy it. Very disappointing
n	Probleam with demo and installation..
n	Hi folks. I have purchased this TV a couple of days ago. Yet to be delivered. I have purchased from a local showroom for 39.5k. Both table and wall mount supplied free of charge. I. Think it requires a stabilizer. Which is a must for a country like India. Will play around with it for a while and provide my opinion shortly.
p	Gameplay may not be as good as pes 16, but still can't stop playing this game...maybe It's because of premier League, which is missing in pes (I know we can edit the kits)..only annoying thing about this game is that cpu just tries to play "chelsea "  all the time... Passing around the back even if they are a goal down in 30mins.  Doesn't make sense, but FUT is fun to play as always...
p	I purchased fifa 16 and it was in bad state on its release.  It's shoots are not good,  goalkeeper always blocks the shot,  online connectivity problems, etc. But it's update made this game a new Fifa 16 then what was at its launch. So those thinking to buy,  get it now and update before playing. Review - 7.6 (At launch) - 8.8( after updates)
p	I placed an order for one day delivery as needed this game urgently to gift to someone. All is well that ends well, got the product on time, absolutely in its best shape, no hampering done to it and the person i got it for jumped with joy and i had a smile on my face.
p	Graphics are stunning. The crowd looks pretty realistic. Dribbling is smooth. The only problem is the passing and player switch. Few glitches. But the enhanced atmosphere and the official bundesliga license makes it an awesome game. The players look stunning with detailed tattoo. Messi's right hand tattoo looks stunning. Overall a must buy game!
p	Amazon happy with your delivery. ...products was really well packed  took some time to open it....☺ . The game is really awesome .this series keeps surprising  me year after year  the game presentation the crowd chant  , players emotions are so freaking  real .....it's a must buy for soccer lovers  thumps up to fifa 16👍👍
n	Don't buy this if you have brought FIFA 15, nothing much has changed. The announcers still say the same thing, the graphics have not been improved much, the bugs from the previous games are still there, I would recommend to those that don't FIFA previously to just buy FIFA 15, as FIFA 15 and FIFA 16 are almost the same. Plus in FIFA 16 the defenders are usually as fast as a striker
n	Available for just 1599 on playstation network. Don't know why amazon not providing similar discounts, just because of the price difference i have to buy from psn. Game quality is fine.
n	Not as great, lot of problems with online gameplay, sometimes you do not find any players online, its ridiculuous, I play all other games online, no such problems.
n	the quality of FIFA is going down every year.Buying PES would be an absolute no-brainer if Konami get the licenses
n	Okay so I didn't purchase the game from Amazon as it takes 3-4 days for them to deliver it here and I preordered it from the Xbox store so that I could play it exactly on the release date... Now about the game... I'm a big big FIFA fan and have bought each and every FIFA  game since FIFA 10. FIFA 16 has some minor changes as compared to FIFA 15 so I thought that after buying every FIFA game for the past 6 years...I won't buy it this year but I got tempted and bought it... There's not much change in the graphics but the game is very defensive.I play on world class and mainly play career mode. No longer I can score 4-5 goals in a game.The opponents defending has got a major boost.Also in FIFA 15/14 if you're plying with Ronaldo or Messi or any player with high dribbling attribute,you could take the ball from defence to attack single handedly without any problem but you can't do that in FIFA 16.You have to have teamwork and passing.The no touch dribbling is good but difficult to perform as most of the times you get tackled and the trick fails. The career mode changes are just ok ok, a pre season tournament and player training,but after all this years there should more changes in the career mode.Also there are some good in game stats like which team is the best defensively(the team with the lowest goals consided) etc. The new addition is the women's team which are good but limited...hope EA sports add more female teams. So,should we buy FIFA 16? If you're a die hard FIFA fan like me or a FIFA fan boy,just grab your copy. If you liked FIFA 15's attacking play then stick to it or buy PES 2016. Although I haven't played PES but this years PES reviews are really really good. Verdict:EA Sports really need to bring a drastic change in the game...only changes in FUT is not enough ..this year they'll face a tough competition against PES 2016. My rating-7/10 Add me on Xbox live GT:Springchaff86
p	Good product. It says light as much as 11w CFL, I feel it is even brighter. Very prompt service as well.
p	Provides enough illumination to cover a small room or bathroom. I'm happy with it
p	Excellent product , value for money,  very bright light and quality body of the bulb compared  to other leading brand i am using. I can say Phillips is ahead than any other led brand in terms of quality and lumen
p	philips product is expensive but as compare  to other  brand it value for money. quality and satisfaction comes with philips product
p	Product is very good, delivery much better got just 3days
n	Its really wrost product... its flickering always... never expected from phillips and Amazon.....
n	Worst product from Philips, it's illumination is good, but it is flickering ( i. e..... Bulb lighting goes up and down automatically even at good & stable voltage conditions. I had never expected such a thing from Philips
n	Good bulb but flickers and since I got it 11 days ago I can't return it. Lets hope the warranty does some good.
n	Both the Bulbs keeps on flickering. Returned on the same day. Not expected from Philips and Amazon
n	Good
p	I just love the Apple Pencil. Amazing product.
p	100% original product apple pencil and it work with my ipad pro perfect
p	Excellent product recd in specified promised time.
p	Amazing and 100% genuine ❤️
n	It should have come included with the iPad pro. Way too expensive which adds to the already high price of the iPad pro. The battery life is also not too impressive lasting a day (for comparison, the surface pen which comes included with the surface pro 4 lasts about year before running out of battery). Also, I have found the charging method of the pencil a but awkward and risky. It plugs into to port of the iPad for recharging, which means you can't use the port while the pencil is charging and you might damage the pencil or your iPad port while using the iPad at the time if by accident your hand or something hits the pencil plugged into the iPad.
p	BEAUTY WITH BRAINS! Update: The SD card issue has been solved in the latest software patch with oxygen OS 2.1.3 INTRODUCTION One Plus, a Chinese smart phone start up, made waves last year, when they launched the much lauded One Plus One. Packed with flagship level internals, and an unbelievable price tag, One Plus One soon became the heartthrob of the smart phone market. Earlier this year, One Plus announced its successor, the One Plus Two. However, the phone could not live up to the hype generated by its predecessor, and the continuance of the invite-only system made prospective buyers look elsewhere. And now, One Plus has launched their first mid-range smart phone, in an attempt to reclaim its lost glory. Will it? UNBOXING Unboxing the One Plus X, I couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the packaging and their attention to detail. You get a charger, a high quality flat-wired micro-USB cable along with the usual literature, and of course the One Plus X itself. One Plus has also included a translucent back cover, but some part of it seemed to stick to the phone and it looked ugly. I am unsure whether this happened with others. Anyways, One Plus has also included a factory-fitted clear- screen guard. But, be careful while peeling off the protective film, as you may remove the screen guard along with it. DESIGN AND BUILD  QUALITY On paper, one plus seems to be a rejigged One Plus One, with the same internals  and price bracket. But one look at the phone and you will know the difference. With glass to the front and back and metal to the sides, this phone looks and feels gorgeous.  The device sports a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 covered  5” AMOLED display, flanked by the earpiece sensors, 8 MP front camera and a notification LED at the top and  the reversible capacitive keys at the bottom. The back has a shiny, glossy, inky-black scratch resistant glass with the One Plus logo and a 13MP camera and LED flash, flush to the back. The edges are metal clad, with 17 high precision microcuts, which gives the phone a good grip. The sim tray (housing a hybrid dual SIM/ microSD card slot), volume rockers and the power button are to the right, while we see the alert slider from the One Plus Two on the left. The top has a 3.5 mm audio jack and the secondary noise cancellation microphone, while the single firing speaker, the micro USB port (not USB type-c) and the primary microphone are at the bottom. The dual speaker grille, out of which only one fires, gives the phone a beautiful symmetry and shows the attention to detail. The front and back panel has 2.5D curved glass that hides the bezels and gives the phone a premium, elegant look.  At about 6.9 mm thick and under 140g, the phone is extremely compact and single handed usage is a breeze. Yes, the glass is a finger print magnet and is slippery, but that is to be expected.  These minor gripes aside, the One Plus X is the best looking phone I have ever seen. It has its inspirations, but it still manages to stand out on its own. DISPLAY As mentioned above, One Plus has gone with an AMOLED panel in the One Plus X, and hence it has punchier colours, deep blacks and excellent viewing angles. The screen has a resolution of 1980x1080 with a pixel density of 441ppi. The display is bright and sharp with no pixilation. An AMOLED display also means One Plus X can make use of features like ambient display (screen lights up when you get a notification) and proximity wake (waving your hand over the sensors will bring up the time and notifications) without eating up the battery life, since only individual pixels needs to turned on, unlike an LCD display. One Plus also has a dark mode enabled by default, which further helps in the battery longevity, while differentiating the phone from other vanilla android counterparts. However the auto brightness was a bit too unreliable and I had to turn it off. I hope a software patch will fix this. And I hope one plus implement a colour calibration option, so that people wanting accurate colour temperatures can tone down the saturation. Also, the whites have a slight bluish tint at certain angles. It is invisible if you won’t look for it, but I thought it was worth mentioning. PERFORMANCE The phone, though a mid-ranger, does not come with mid-range internals. Instead of going for a Snapdragon 615 or a 617, One Plus has packed this phone with last year’s Snapdragon 801 chipset. This means, the phone has  four Krait 400 cores, clocked at 2.3 GHz each, and an Adreno 330 GPU (clocked at 578 MHz). It has 3 GB of RAM an 16 GB of onboard storage, out of which about 11 GB is free on the first boot (the storage is expandable).  Note that, contrary to reports, this is not the Snapdragon 801 used in the One Plus One. That was an overclocked CPU, namely, the MSM8974AC. The one used in the One Plus X is the MSM8974AB. This doesn’t mean much to the normal user, for whom, the performance will be a breeze. Apps open quickly, there is minimal lag and the huge RAM means multitasking is never a problem. Even gaming was a pleasant experience, with even high-end games like Modern Combat 5 played fine. Only Asphalt 8 displayed slight choppiness, but that may be a software issue due to lack of optimisation, which will, most likely, be fixed.  In fact only if you compare it with the current gen flagships, would you notice any difference, which is excellent for a mid-ranger. There s slight heating in the back panel, when the device is put to intensive usage, but it does not get over the 45 Celsius mark Many would lament the absence of a 64 bit processing unit, but honestly, for that technology to become the norm, it would take at least a few more years, and until then it is just a spec to gloat about. HARDWARE The One Plus X continues the dual sim functionality introduced in the one plus 2, but this time, it is a hybrid slot! Yes, one plus finally has a device which supports microSD upto 128 GB, that is, if you omit the dual sim functionality. There are two nano sim slots, with the second one doubling up as a microSD card slot. Both sim slots support 4G LTE, but only one can be activated at a time, while the other will run on 2G. The alert slider is also a useful feature, and has been revamped for a more pronounced texture and better feedback. There are three options; slide from the bottom, once for priority notifications and twice for no notification while the option at the bottom enables all notifications. The volume output from the bottom-firing speaker is pretty loud and clear, though a wee bit tinny. An inbuilt equalizer could solve the problem by bumping up the bass. However the volume output from the headphone jack was excellent. I tested it with the Xiaomi Pistion 3 and the Audio Technica ATH M20-x and I was impressed. The vocals are great, there is no breaking and the bass is adequate. The call quality via the microphone and the signal reception too were excellent, though I must say I had a couple of call drops. This might be a carrier issue, but I am not sure. A lot of hardware features present in the One Plus One and one plus two have been omitted. There is no NFC, so Android Pay is off.  The fingerprint scanner is also omitted, probably to cut costs. Along with these, there are also some unnecessary omissions which One Plus seems to have made. For one, the capacitive keys aren’t backlit. And more importantly, the more powerful  5 GHz WiFi band is missing.  For US buyers, a major issue might be the lack of LTE, with bands 12 and 17 not supported. This means both T Mobile and AT&T; customers will be stuck on the HSPA networks (3G). However, most international customers have no such issues and in India, Airtel’s 1800MHz and 2300MHz bands are fully supported. There is also no wireless charging or quick charging, and the USB-C type found in the One Plus Two has been replaced by the older micro USB port. BATTERY The One Plus X packs in 2525 mAh battery, and the battery life is above average. On a moderate day of usage, you will be able to last a full day with about 3.5-4 hours of screen-on-time. However, with a day of heavy usage, you might last only about 9 hours with 5 hours screen-on-time. On a looping video playback test in half brightness and full volume (in MX Player), the phone drained from 100% to 0% in about 8 hours. Though wireless charging and fast charging aren’t supported, it doesn’t make a huge difference, as the small 2525 mAh battery charges up reasonably fast with the included accessories SOFTWARE The One Plus X runs on Android 5.1.1, lollipop. However, after the bitter breakup with Cyanogen, One Plus X runs on its own custom android skin Oxygen OS 2.1.2. However, unlike other manufacturer overlays, one plus has a bloat free, almost vanilla interface with some nifty features added for customisation. First, there is the dark mode, which inverts the stock android look. There are features like App permissions (permissions manager on a per-app level), notifications manager (micro-manage app notifications) and quick settings management (choose which quick settings to be displayed in the notification toggle). The Shelf feature from the One Plus Two makes a return. Shelf is a feature which displays your widgets, recent apps and contacts in the leftmost home screen. It is harmless and useful at times, and at worst, it can be turned off. The gesture support from the previous one plus iterations, including double tap to wake, drawing an O or a V to open the camera and turn on the flash light from the lock screen respectively are also present and accounted for. Minor customisations like the ability to change the LED notification and the accent colour gives the user to make minor cosmetic yet unobtrusive changes to the UI. The ability to turn on screen navigation overlay and swap buttons are highly appreciated, especially since the capacitive buttons aren’t backlit. A huge bug in the UI is in the microSD detection. While the file manager shows the card, and you can use it for multimedia storage, it doesn’t show up in the storage options, thereby not allowing apps to be moved to the SD card. The good news is, One Plus is aware of the issue and an OTA update is promised. All in all, Oxygen OS is a great Android UI, one of the few which gives valuable customisation options without tinkering with Google’s version of an Android experience. It is also quite stable with no app crashes or slow downs. At worst, the added features can be ignored and you can enjoy a stock android experience. Add to that, One Plus has an excellent software team working round the clock, solving bugs, making performance improvements and adding features. The Marshmallow update is also promised in the next year Q1, so software wise, you are covered. CAMERA The One Plus X comes packed with 13 MP (4:3 aspect ratio) rear camera with LED flash, while there is an 8MP fixed focus front facing camera for selfie lovers. The primary camera, contrary to reports is not the same one used in either of the two previous One Plus smart phones. One Plus, this time went with a Samsung ISOCELL sensor with an f2.2 aperture and phase detection autofocus. This is the same sensor used in the Samsung Galaxy S5, but the similarity ends there. The photos are average at best, with unreliable exposure compensation and colour accuracy. Sometimes, the photos come out pretty good, while other times, it’s pretty disappointing. However, there is minimal shutter lag, the dynamic range is good and the saturation levels give punchier photos. The detailing and sharpness are also pretty good, as long as you don’t zoom in. All this is however in outdoor shots, with high noise levels creeping in, in low light and artificial lighting conditions. Move in to video, and it gets terrible. The video maxes out at 1080p, and that too is very bad. It is shaky, loses focus quickly and has a lot of ghost effects. The front facing camera, on the other hand is excellent. With a wide angle lens and an f2.4 aperture, even artificial lighting produces great results.  The beauty mode also helps without going overboard. The video quality of the front camera is also pretty good for Skype calls, and it also shoots at 1080p. The camera app is bare bones, and offers basic features like a timer, panorama, slow motion and time lapse. Swipe up or down in the viewfinder for modes, and oddly, in the panorama mode, the orientation shifts to portrait mode, which is annoying. The photo mode also has clear image and HDR. While clear image is pretty good (it takes 10 shots of the same image to create the perfect shot, in theory), HDR just cranks up the exposure, without doing anything about the blown up highlights. And both take a couple seconds extra, though that is acceptable. The ring along with the focus tap, to adjust exposure is a welcome feature, though it is not as perfected as the one, say, in MIUI. Overall, the camera is the phone’s weakest link, though it has to do more with software than hardware. I am sure, the camera interface and the quality will improve in coming times. And, don’t get me wrong, this camera is perfect for social media and instagramming, it’s just not for photography geeks. MY TAKE Overall, despite its flaws and trade-offs, One Plus X is a solid phone. And at a price of Rs 16999 or $249, it is the best smart phone money can buy! That is – if you can get your hands on an invite. This time, however, invites are available in plenty, and more often than not, you can grab an invite with a little effort. Moreover, the phone will go on open sale within a month, so that should please a lot of people. In my opinion, no phone is perfect. And everything comes at a price. For me, I need great looks, a great performance, and decent battery life. Issues like lack of NFC, a 64bit processor, 5GHz WiFi band, a finger print scanner and fast charging doesn’t matter to me, for I don’t use any of these. And I like a minimalistic and aesthetic design, so I like One Plus X more than the One Plus One too. So, in my humble, personal opinion, I love the OPX. I think it is a great phone. Some of cons do not affect me, others I trust the company to fix soon. But,I diligently, mentioned all the pros and cons of the device, to the best of my abilities, now the choice is yours. My opinion – GO FOR IT! PS: there is a limited edition ceramic variant also available in Europe and India for a higher price of Rs.22999. It is entirely the same as the variant reviewed here (Onyx), other than the built (fire-baked ceramic). This is my first review, so if you liked it, I would appreciate an upvote.

p	Hi All, Thanks all for those who made my review as helpful one... On this days I  faced few issues thought to share it with solutions.... Feel free to share your thoughts.. 1) Vibrates while on call: Its not for everyone I have checked on few forums some of them facing this issue.. I do have this issue.. They said its because of some bug on "double tap to wake option".. pls disable it in the gesture settings.. I tried this yesterday for a day it worked.. 2) Not able to get into Apps Menu: I faced this issue on last week friday.. I'm able to unlock the screen and I can access homepage and frequently used apps by right swiping.. BUT not able to get into the Apps menu/Main Menu list from home page.. it automatically comes out to home page if I try for Apps Menu list.. I spoke with Oneplus Customer care.. they asked to do factory reset.. I did :( ..  then only I got to know some solutions in the forums that by enabling google search bar in the home page menu that pblm will be solved.. I faced this issue again and I tried it.. It Worked... Other than this its working well for me.. As I have mentioned this is my first review anything abt the mobile which I bought recently.. Oneplus X.. If u feel anything wrong in my comment.. pls share it.. Before getting to the CONS and PROS.. I would like to mention few things before you buy Oneplus X.. 1. I have seen few complaints that they are not able to download apps from playstore.. I too faced the issue initially.. I tried few steps and I'm able to download the apps now.. First clear the cache in Google Play Services and also the Clear All Data for the same and deleted the google account and restart the phone and add google account 2. Second thing about memory card not supporting issue.. its support memory card but on the initial stage it will not show on the storage settings after the second update from oneplus it will show you the SD card option. 3. About Camera Manual Mode - On the recent update (2.2.0) they have updated manual mode also u can move apps to SD card (even camera application to SD card) 4. They have battery saver mode option.. so it helps on battery draining.. U can set when the battery saver has to turn on.. 5. Also here you can use the network selections like 4G, 3G or 2G.. so u have an option to reduce the internet usage (I believe this will known to everyone) Now coming to PROS and CONS PROS 1. It has good design.. As so many of them mentioned its looks like upgraded version and combined of iPhone 4S and Sony Xperia designs.. It really nice.. As per my point of view.. 2. Its display quality is AWESOME.. I tried playing Asphalt 8.. its graphics view are really great!!! 3. About Performance its working very well.. No lags as of now.. I've been using it for past 6 days.. 4. Many of them said its camera is not good.. But as per my view on the daylight it gives very good quality of images... really its nice.. We have to know how to use it.. there r few options u can choose it like HDR, Beauty, Clear Images, etc.. As I mentioned now they update manual mode as well.. so its working well.. CONS 1.As most of you heard it has some heating issues.. But its not over heating.. On recent days every mobile gets heating because of higher performance and usage.. This heating issue also I faced only on Playing Games.. Again I'm saying its acceptable as its common with this days.. 2. Battery - Yeah its draining little faster while playing games.. It suddenly reduced from 100% to 99 after few minutes of charged.. As of now I'm getting upto 1 day with regular usage of calls,whatsapp, gaming and videos.. 3. Camera - On very low light it has noise/not clear image as compared to Daylight Images.. But with good light condition it has good quality.. About Flash its works well for portrait and inside room condition.. If I made bad writeup.. dont take it serious :)
p	This is what you all want under 17000/- INR.  Let's start with its display Must say it's better than previous One plus  devices as I have One plus 2.  Well Oneplus X has amoled display of 441ppi.  Colors are more deep and sharp. About body What a fabulous design.  Inherited from Apple iPhone 4S and some of their own like alert slider and slim Ness.  Must say it's beauty.  Metal frame from side and back panel made of glass makes you feel richer. Camera Front Camera is good but little disappointed with rear.  Auto focus wasn't that much better and pics wasn't that much good maybe a software bug. So it will be resolved. Well Now performance 3GB of ram with 2.3Ghz clocked makes sense but perhaps when you get the hands on this phone you won't feel like to play games in this beauty.  These hardware will later allow you to customize your device like rooting and take it to next level.  You can play games in this but the dimension and thinness of this device won't let you play for long.  So upto you and I don't recommend to play High end games in this as of heating issue which is in the genes of Snapdragon 801 soc processor. Well this is it.  Thanks for reading it. If you have 20000 /- wait for yutopia then or else go for this blindly. Remember  it comes with previous applied screen protector and now this time with transparent back cover also. Thanks for reading this.  Hit like if you find it helpful to you.
p	Just received the Phone. Here is the Initial review of the Phone: Build: The build for the phone feels solid, Glass front and back, Attracts a LOT of fingerprint. Luckily there is a Silicon Case provided in the box. I would not use the Phone without a protective case. Looks: 10/10, Stunning looks, fashionable for sure. Performance: The phone is smooth and fluid, Does heat up on the top left corner when gaming for 30+ Mins, Dual Sim works fine, yet to test it with a microSD Card. The screen being AMOLED is a BIG ADVANTAGE. It renders neat blacks and bright colors, the best screen by OnePlus as of now. Not much to say at this point about performance, will update the review in a few days. Things to Note: 1. The phone has a pre installed screen guard, take care while removing the front screen cover when out of box, chances are, you will pull the screen guard apart too. 2. Silicone Case is provided in the box. Good move, because there are no other cases available as on date. Cons: The glass build, is nice to have but I would be double cautious with the phone, A single drop might break the screen is what I am scared about. No NFC. But no one used it anyway.
p	This is the undoubtedly the best mobile phone one can get under 20k keeping in mind its brand value, hardware and its absolutely gorgeous looks. To anyone at first glance, it looks like at least a 50k phone. It has a nice slim design, with black glass both at the front and back. The metallic rim has lines engraved for superior grip and feel. Pros:- 1.) Performance : Brilliant performance with no lag whatsoever. Gaming is butter smooth. No complaints here. 2.) Looks : As I have mentioned before, this phone looks costlier than it actually is. It's slim body gives it superior feel. And, surprisingly it is not heavy at all. 3.) Display : It's 1080p AMOLED screen is treat for the eyes. Colour reproduction and pixel density is perfect for crisp sharp display with high colour contrast. I personally like the 5-inch phones because they are easy to handle and operate with one hand. 4.) Camera : The quality of both front(8 MP) and back(12.4 MP)  camera is quite remarkable with sharp images. Low-light images are somewhat grainy but not too bad for my liking.The camera app is stock android with in-built features of Timelapse, Slow-Mo video recording, Panorama etc. Cons : 1.) OxygenOS 2.1 I personally love customizing my Android phone and OxygenOS really lacks in that. With some minimum features like Dark Mode Theme, rearranging of Status bar tiles and the support of a few gestures, CyanogenOS is much better in that respect. But, if you like the stock android feel, then this OS won't disappoint you.It doesn't come preloaded with many apps and is very close to Stock Android OS that comes loaded in the Moto and Nexus Series. 2.)It is a Dual SIM OR a Single SIM + SD Card. You cannot have a Dual SIM + SD card. It uses the SIM2 slot as SD card slot. So if you want a Dual SIM + SD card, this will disappoint you. 3.) After Sales Support. Oneplus as a company is indeed trying to improve its customer support but currently it is not upto the mark. With very few Service Centers available, it could be a hassle for you if the need of servicing arises. Overall Verdict: OxygenOS is still in its infancy. I am sure future updates will give it more customisabality. And if you are a customization freak, I am sure you can flash the ROM of your choice ;) For me, it is the best 17k I have ever spent. PS: I will add some Camera photos for you to judge soon.
n	One plus x doesn't allow u to choose the SIM to make a call. Whatever preference u set in call settings, either of ur two sims is used to call irrespective of ur choice. Called their technical support n they said the issue will b resolved in next oxygen update. Keeping fingers crossed. Till then wud advise u guys to not purchase it. Hope this issue gets resolved, else will return my one plus x on Amazon n maybe buy a moto x play...
n	Waited in the queue for Invite. Received the invite yesterday and have placed the order. Received the product today and was excited to open and review the unit. And here comes the disappointment. The display of the phone was damaged. Not the thing which I was expecting from One plus. I have been using One plus One from past one year and did not had any issue. After seeing this damaged product I think One plus is planning to lose customers base in India. Hoping to get the replacement unit as soon as possible.
n	Worst phone with soo many issues. Will never refer it to any body First the battery drains off very often. Second the screen freezes like multiple times a day. Third the speaker is too low is like listening from the farthest end of the world or under the water. For all these issues when contacted the customer care the response makes you feel its the most bad choice made. They say they dont guarantee the software and top of it i had bad screen freeze problem which they said is software issue. Hope the consumers are educated about this phone before they buy it.
n	This review is specifically made to mention that the phone takes hell lot of time to get fully charged min 2 hrs, and battery drains early when compared to charging rate. The phone is good on performance but as everyone said the 'best deal in its price', its not so look is mind blowing, works smoothly but battery charge and drain ration is something i could not ignore So be informed. Thanks.
n	Hi Everyone, Please read this review before you consider buying the Oneplus X. The biggest issue many users are facing including me is the dual SIM bug in the Oxygen OS 2.1.3. Let me explain in detail, I am a dual sim user and was using Moto G2 previously which had dual sim slots & a Micro SD slot (Not complaining about the Oneplus X's hybrid sim slot). Since Oneplus X had ample internal memory (11 GB for users), I inserted two nano SIMs and started testing the call quality, At first when I made a call from SIM2, the carrier displayed was of SIM1, I thought I was confused between my carriers and went and checked the SIM 1 & SIM 2 carriers. Then as I began calling again from SIM2, I noticed that the calls go from SIM1 by default even when you select SIM2. This was a major setback for me. I started searching if I was the only one facing this problem, I found that this was a major issue across Oneplus 2 & Oneplus X users. Even the Oneplus India Customer support acknowledged this issue and asked me to wait for an OTA Fix!!!(Kudos Oneplus Team for asking the customer to wait rather than replacing the one day new mobile. What an awesome Support team u guys have.). When I raised it on twitter I received similar answers asking to do a factory reset which I did and  the problem still persists. Another bug is that, the call history in the dialer does not show the names of the recently called even if the contact number is saved in google account. I had to use a third party dialer (Truedialer) to overcome the bug. Even though this mobile is loaded with awesome specs and the performance for the two days that I used was fantastic, the Oneplus team couldn't even get the basics right for their so called Mobiles including their Flagships (OP2). I switched back to my old Moto G2 and it was a bliss to use. Team Oneplus: NEVER SETTLE huh!! Seriously think of changing your tagline to something more believable like "CHALE THO CHAAND TAK NAHI THO SHAAM TAK"
p	Xiaomi is just a one-year-old brand for India and it took only one year to beat all other old and big brands just because of their business model, price, quality and MIUI. The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give best. I have bought all Xiaomi India products and none of them required to visit a service center to date. The first device they launched in India was the MI3 and I got it in the first sale and it still works like the new device. The Redmi Note Prime is the not the latest Note device they have in the International market, as they have already launched Redmi Note 2, Redmi Note 2 Prime and the Redmi Note 3 in the international market but they all have the MediaTek processor and they have been prohibited from sale these MediaTek phones in India due to some patent issues, so they launched the Redmi Note Prime with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 (which is not outdated yet) especially for the Indians and made in India. ----------------------------- UPDATE(14/01/2016) ----------------------------- Xiaomi will launch Redmi Note 3 variant with Snapdragon 650 SoC especially for India in coming months but I don't think it will carry a price tag under 10k as it has upgraded Snapdragon 650 chip, 16MP camera and a big 4000mAh Big Battery and full metal body. So you can still choose Redmi Note Prime if you are low on budget. ----------------------------- UPDATE(25/01/2016) ----------------------------- According to some reviews people reporting battery drain because of Mediaserver. Let me clear it that it's not a hardware fault, Some corrupt or MKV files on internal or external storage(SD card) that media server tries to index and it results in endless looping and it causes heating with battery drain. Quick Fix For Battery Drain: Delete all MKV files from the internal and external storage and restart the phone. Hope it helped..!! ------- PROS: ------- 1. MADE IN INDIA (Check the image) 2. MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most customizable,  powerful, features packed android user interface. You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps. 3. Overall good built quality, and especially the camera lens has the O-ring around it to protect it from scratches even if you use it without cases/covers. 4. Stunning 13.97cm (5.5") HD IPS display. (Bigger the display more the productivity.) 5. Fast 2GB LPDDR3 RAM with 16GB Flash memory with read speed of 100MB/s and write speed of 50MB/s. (Faster the memory, lesser the loading and launching time of the apps) 6. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 1.2GHz quad-core processor. It also has a 64-bit capability, which is faster and more powerful than 32-bit processors and allows for more efficient processing and memory use. 7. Adreno 306 supports DirectX, OpenCL, FlexRender and other PC gaming technologies for a richer gaming support and experience. 8. The menu, Home and Back keys are red backlit keys, looks sexy. (Check the image) 9. 4G, Dual sim and MircoSD slot. 10. The excellent output from the 3.5mm jack, all you need is a good pair of earphone. I tested it with XB70AP. 11. Big 3100 mAh high-capacity battery coupled with power efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and the battery saving features of MIUI makes it one of the most longer battery life smartphone. 12. 13MP rear camera | 5MP front camera are not the best 13MP and 5MP camera but it performs better than many phones and best at this price tag. 13. Good quality 2amp charger. -------- CONS: -------- 1. Big for the 5.5-inch screen size, not for the people who are looking for a pocket-friendly phone. I have added a picture of Redmi Note Prime without any case and my OnePlus One with bulky Diztronic Ultra TPU Case on it and they seem the same size. 2. Glossy back, I'm not a good fan of glossy stuff as they get scratched very easily and visibility of scratches are high also the glossy surface feel a bit sleepy in hands than the matte surface. I have added the picture of it with its little sister Redmi 2 with the matte finish on the back. 3. There is no space on the bezel or in the back panel where you can put your nail/finger and open it. 4. The speaker is placed on the back side and the output from the speaker in all Xiaomi phones is average or below average in this case this phone won't be audible in the noisy environment and from the another room. 5. MIUI7 used in this phone has the base of Android KitKat 4.4.4 which is 2 years  old android version. --------------- VERDICT: --------------- You can't ask for more at this price tag, Redmi Note Prime is the best 5.5-inch screen phone at this price tag. If you are low on budget and want a big screen, long battery life and full featured packed phone then you can blindly go for the Redmi Note Prime. PS: I am providing some pictures of the product for better understanding as "A picture can speak a Thousand words"(I already wrote more than 500 words). Just in case, you like my review don't forget to hit the 'YES/HELPFUL' button below. It does encourage me to buy stuff from amazon for review.
p	Very good value for money.. Battery is good. Interface is bit tricky to use initially especially if you are switching from standard android interface. Wifi tends to disconnect frequently. Otherwise no issues.. Screen is excellent but camera is average
p	Guys!! If u are getting faulty product..then please buy from MI.COM, there is very less chance(like  zero percent) to get faulty product... And trust me phone is totally worth it for price....people,who are seeking for high specs, can go for apple or anywhere else.. Those who are talking about heating issues must understand that if u are playing games, using internet etc. while charging, then obviously it will get heated...any phone will get heat....even iphone also heats..if you are doing so many things while charging... One more thing battery should always be in 40 to 80 percent..i mean always keep ur battery above 40 percent( BATTERY SHOULD ALSO BREATH PROPERLY OK!!) for better battery, healthy battery and heating issues. >>FOR ALL SMARTPHONES.<< GUYS MIND IT!!! IF U HAVE BELOW 40% BATTERY, IT WILL HEAT EVEN ONLY IF U TALK. . CAMERA,BATTERY AND DISPLAY TOTALLY JUSTIFIES. When you receive the product, firstly u must update and secondly you should do factory reset, then use it.. mi.com delivered the phone to me in 46 hours.
p	Mobile worked fine. I recd the sealed box which had empty pouch of earphone.  How will I get them
p	i love it
n	Xiaomi played a Trick here but i am not sure if it would work. This phone is Actually The Redmi Note 4G, but with a Different name and an extra Sim Slot....What is New in this then ?? Same 1 year Old Model I dont understand WHY to launch an already Discontinued devices when you have a Lot of devices (Mi 5 which might never launch i guess) Xiaomi India is taking credit of it but i dont see anything NEW as such in the phone. The Company is NOT launching any good phone now like REDMI NOTE 3 & REDMI NOTE 3 PRIME , due to Legal issues. You launch Good devices in CHINA and launch such devices which dont sell there anymore ,to dispose off in India. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE. And customers should make it clear to such brand that there are Many other Brands Which we can Opt. Its not that Only Xiaomi is the One in Market. If INDIAN Customers have given Xiaomi that Market BOOST , They can take that Back too. Atleast it should keep in Mind that INDIAN users are Not to be Served an OUTDATED phone. We want better specifications too which have been launched worldwide. This launch by Xiaomi shows they just want to OUTSTOCK their Old phones , and surprisingly customers are happy with this also. I dont find any good reason to Buy this phone being an model 1 year Old , just a Big Publicity Launching would Not make it go Far..!! THIS IS OUTDATED ....Not recommended at All !!! LIKE THIS COMMENT TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT EVEN WE WANT UPDATED PHONES WHICH ARE LAUNCHED WORLDWIDE AND SUCH DEVICES ARE NOT ACCEPTED BEING OUT OF MARKET TRENDS...!!!
n	hi Dear  5 star Keyboard warriors .Please read my reviews and give expert advice . I brought this phone last week and in 3 days these are the defects i found 1 . ii have attached the screen shot for reference . This phone has a media server app that takes almost 70 % of your battery . This app cannot be force stopped (this app is used to scan all media files and refresh in your gallery). So if you charge your phone 100 % it will be 65 % in jus half and hour even on standby because of this app. And the back panel of phone heats so much that its is very useful during winter to keep you warm :P. Trust me my pant gets warm as soon i slide my phone in pocket in jus 3 minutes.Mounting External SD card will make the media server app go worse . So solution is dont add any files on your phone to keep media server quite and get high battery life.. 2 The apps cannot be moved to memory card so you have to use the only 11 gb space available in phone for apps (half will be consumed by whats app :P ) . and don even think of rooting the phone ,if you root by seeing the you tube videos (MOST ARE ONLY FOR REDMI PRIME /REDMI NOTE 4G) .If u root it any ways you wont get any updates to install. 3 there is no search option in music player provided in phone , so if u like that one song among 700 songs you have to scroll way down to get that one song to listen.So if you install any other music app which has search option, it will only scan your internal storage songs not external storage songs. I have reported all these bugs to xiaomi , still no action taken ..oooops i forgot why will they take any action .. i already got scammed with 8500 rs by them :P online chat and support  numbers also dont respond :D only updates and fixes can save my phone. this is all i could find the most non user friendly thing in this outdated phone in 3 days . will post more on this . OVERALL I HAVE MADE YET ANOTHER STUPID DECISON IN MY LIFE AND STILL LAUGH ABOUT IT :D
n	What the hell is going on at Xiaomi ? Same spec, same design and worst of of when all the other phones are moving to Android Marshmallow, but they are still stuck with Kit Kat. Piece of crap.. they seem to be dumping useless, unmarketable devices from China to India.. my  Advice: DON'T buy this crap !!!!
n	Not worth for the price and all specs are outdated. In China they released redmi note 3 with fingerprint and 4000 mah battery. They think India is dumping ground. Better go for Coolpad.
n	I'm an MI user for the last 6 months. I order Xiaomi Redmi Note Prime (White, 16 GB) for my family member but got a BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT the moment we insert the SIM. I had faith on MI so initially i thought it might be a bug and restart it but nothing happen. And the following porblem remain same : 1. Never shut down, only restart 2. Keypad " I " (for India) never worked. When we press I, it works as Backspace. Funny huh. 3. All apps runs at once or whenever the app wants it. 4. Think if your Mobile data gets on / off automatically when all the apps are running. 5. Even the worst part it can call to any number at any time automatically, even normal lock. finally we felt to return the phone. Requested AMAZON and the next day some resources came to pick the phone and within 2-3 days we got the money back in our account. Thanks AMAZON.
p	This is not a competition for your usual android tablets. There is simply no comparison because it is PC in a tablet form factor. If you think of a tablet just as an enlarged version of a smartphone, you will find it very costly. However, if you love your apple devices, then you will love this and appreciate the difference in quality and performance. It runs the full windows 10 OS so anything and everything you can do on your PC, you can do it here. Some people have commented about battery and heating issues, but I believe that was in some devices and firmware updates have been out already to address those. I have seen this device run all day and it gets only moderately warm. My dell latitude gets that much warm in about half an hour. even Intel i5 is more than enough processing power for all that one could think of baring someone having a need to do animation programming or run very heavy games on it. for those, you have to go for i7 version. Now the fun part. Its form factor. We are talking about a serious laptop, but it is just 8 mm in thickness and you can literally hide it inside a photographer's jacket. It is incredibly light, yet very sturdy and strong. I do hope that type cover was included in this price because it is a must have. It is a perfect device for those planning to buy an iPad or Macbook. It is a must for those who want both an iPad and a Macbook.
p	Let's start with the golden question of Indian masses i.e. battery life, I've been getting ~6-7 hours of battery life on the SP4 which is quite nice. I would recommend this tablet for professionals that walk or travel a lot, and do NOT need all day battery on a single charge. The new Surface Pen is very nice, with the tail end acting as an eraser. The screen is not too small like the iPad, neither is it bulky like a laptop. The screen resolution is high and text/videos are crisp and easy to read/watch. The magnet on the left side of the SP4 is surprising strong and holds the Surface Pen well.The magnet on the right side is significantly weaker but it can hold the pen well. The kickstand works perfectly and stays in the position I set it to. The SP4 Type Cover feels great and protects your screen when you aren't using it. High end Gamers shouldn't buy it, but it could run some games if you decide to do so.That being said, the gaming experience was rather unpleasant. Software-wise,It looks and performs exactly like Windows 10 should on a normal desktop or laptop. The device is very responsive and has fast storage. The tablet does charge quite quickly. Microsoft is rolling out updates continuously that are addressing most of the issues. The tablet's cameras are also quite good, though I don't consider that a huge plus as I'm not going to be using this for picture taking. I haven't had any overheating issues which was a huge issue on some previous devices and I can't find any issues with the build quality. In short, it's got an amazing screen, solid build quality, is very light, and does not get too hot. Pros:) Pen input that is a step above competition Incredible screen Great performance (running Core i5/128GB model) Sleek, light design Type cover has great feel Integrated kickstand that actually works in all positions Separate magnetic charge connector Expandable storage (micro SD) Cons:( Mediocre battery life Single USB port (which can annoy you at certain situations) Expensive (more with the cover) Mini Display port needs adapter ( can't use directly) At the end of the day,I don't think anyone else offers the performance and quality that the Surface Pro 4 has in the same lightweight and thin chassis.

p	If you are thinking the price is worth or not..let me tell you it definitely is! It is not a tablet. It is a proper full fledged laptop which is also a tablet. Desktop softwares and apps both work flawlessly. External hdd, cd drive, external display, SD card all work! Also it is has a pencil which beats all the styluses before. Its a future of all laptops.
p	Watch this review of surface pro.. solution of all your FAQ : https://youtu.be/DimKX9YdhG8
p	Bought surface pro 4 256 GB when it was still not available in India. I was very sceptical about this device in the beginning, but slowly and steadily it won my heart over by its charm. This is an awesome device, packed with power and style. Do not be let down by the joker posts giving it 1,2,3 rating. Its a 5 star device. The built is very good, the form is beautiful and weights like a feather. It's screen is best ever in the world and is too good to believe. The speed is good too. But , yes there is a BUT here also. The battery is avg. There is this and only this problem, to this otherwise God device. It gives around 4 to 5 hours on battery which I wished to be better. And, the price. But every premium ting comes at a price. I bought it in $1299 which is a bit cheaper that in India. Overall, I just love this device.
n	You're probably looking at purchasing this device because you're intrigued by this form factor. It really is a tablet that can transform into a laptop, and even a desktop, given the right accessories, (more on that later). It's light. It's reasonably quick. I have the 4 GB Ram, 128 GB SSD version, and it performs most daily tasks with ease. Performance You can't really expect this configuration to play high end games. But mobile games (like the ones you buy off the windows store) are playable. I don't work in Autocad and Adobe Photoshop but people have run those kinds of software on it. Just not very well. Still, it would work in a pinch. When running more CPU intensive tasks, the fans run up to a very audible whir. It didn't bother me personally. But it's not like an iPad for example. It is a full fledged i5 CPU so that is expected. But internet browsing and office work great. Battery life It's decent at best. I have got upto 5 to 6 hours using multiple chrome tabs. It's not as good as say a Macbook Pro or Macbook Air, but it's not bad for a pc this small and this thin. As a tablet The form is great. A tad on the heavier side. Where it fails as a tablet is the way it goes to sleep and wakes up. Just don't expect it to turn on instantly after it's been lying around idly for long. Also, even with all the work Microsoft has put into Windows 10, it does not feel complete. Buttons are frequently too small to click on. You can customise your display scaling, but not everything scales up correctly. A lot of software is not optimised for High DPI screens. Though this can change, we're in 2016 and these resolutions have been around for several years now, and I am personally tired of waiting. As a laptop I also bought the surface pro 4 type cover when it came out, don't bother buying the surface pro 3 type cover, it's TERRIBLE in comparison. The new one has the larger trackpad and keys that are nicer to type on. But both type covers will quite frequently stop working, especially when you resume from sleep. Usually, a simple disconnect and reconnect will make it work. Other times a restart is required. Yes, even now. Even after all the software updates. The mouse just stops responding to the trackpad. What is surprising is that this is Microsoft's own baby. As a Desktop I also bought the surface pro dock. This gives you an additional 4 USB ports and two mini display ports. Which is great. The ports are USB 3.0 and transfer are fast. As a notebook. It's quite functional for note taking. I've used it extensively to take hand written notes and markup pdfs. This is in fact the number one reason you should even consider this device. If you don't need a pen to write on your screen with, you really should question why you would purchase this device at all. Now the bad stuff. The software is too flaky. I've been patiently waiting for over a year for things to sort out. Microsoft has regularly provided updates and some of the initial issues have gone away. But many have not and frequently, new ones crop up. The wifi would regularly not connect after waking up from sleep. This appears to have been fixed. The touchpad frequently does not respond, especially waking up from sleep. This is still an issue. The pen button sometimes fails to open Onenote like it's supposed to. The pen sometimes acts like it's "Touching" even though you're just hovering, making it impossible to write with. This just comes and goes even though I haven't done anything differently.  I've owned several galaxy note devices for the last 4 years, and it's NEVER happened like this before. I've tried calling microsoft support in India, and I've just been passed around from one department to another eventually reaching an overseas call centre which was closed during our working times. Oh, and because the power button juts out of the body, it is very easy to wake up the device while it's lying in your bag. I've carried a fully charged device from home only to find it completely drained when I take it out hours later. No device is really perfect. I've also found my Macbook Pro to behave unexpectedly. But it's never been with such frequency with such basic actions such as the touchpad. I know people who also have the surface pro 4 and still have sleep/wake issues. I know the issues will eventually go away. But my advice to you now would be to save your money unless you really really need that pen. Even then there are a LOT many more options out there. Another thing to consider is that this device is especially overpriced in India. In a word; should you buy this? No.
n	Had to return the product since the Tab started giving trouble from the day1. Had to reboot 3 times. Pencil stopped responding. I hope hogher models with 8 GB Ram will perform better.
n	To be clear, I wanted a light weight product which can run full suite of applications and it portable. Surface Pro 4 seemed like an ideal product for this purpose. I per-ordered it. But after using it for 3 days, I returned it back to Amazon. It was over all very nice, but it was not as good as you would like a Rs 1,33,000( 121k + 12k) product to be. Pros: Very lightweight and portable. Pro + Keyboard weight just less than 1100 grams in total. Very Powerful. I got the one with i5 processor. It was able to handle multiple applications simultaneously easily. Awesome Display. Running 4k videos 267 ppi screen looks great. Touch Screen. It felt really good to be able to use the Pro 4 in Tablet mode. Cons: Too many software bugs. It was the main issue that forced me to return the surface pro 4. Examples: - Sometimes attached keyboard type cover will stop responding and then you have to detach and reattach it. - Other times touchscreen will stop responding with keyboard and then you have to detach keyboard. - Sometimes tablet will not come out of sleep mode and you have to press power button 4-5 times. - Screen has a very high resolution and many application on windows do not scale properly. For example, in VLC player, control icons like play pause buttons were way too small. - Sometimes windows will try to scale scaling incompatible applications and it will completely tear the application apart.  You might end up with things like overlapping buttons. I know a lot of these issues might be ironed out in future software updates, but in a device that costs as much as Surface Pro 4 you expect a smooth experience at purchase itself. Only one USB port. I connected my surface Pro 4 with external monitor to get some work done and then realized that I cannot connect external keyboard and mouse at the same time. And keep in mind, Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI converted was extremely difficult to find and it was quite expensive. Kickstand: Although It looks sturdy, I feel like it might give away within a year or two of use. One other problem, I generally use laptops in my lap and I constantly change positions (My problem, I know), but every time I change position I have to change the position of kickstand. Battery Life: Mediocre battery life. Battery drained in 4 hrs of you tube streaming on a good WiFi connection. Not enough support: In India, as of now, there is no way to extent warranty of Surface Pro 4. Surface Pro 4 is extremely difficult to open and lot of parts are glued in. Even a simple task as replacing battery could be a headache without support. I don't know how much will it cost if there is any hardware defect after the expiration of warranty. Overall - If you are looking for a Tablet which you can sometimes also use as a Laptop, this is ideal product. But if you are planning to replace you laptop with a surface pro 4, that might not be a good decision. Note: After returning Surface Pro 4, I ordered a Mac-book Pro 13 with Retina Display. I am a first time Mac user and I am absolutely loving it. Yes, there are some software limitations, but overall experience is far better than Surface Pro 4.
n	Though I say it's awesome and all my friends have it but the thing is I need it atleast for 75000₹ To buy it
n	Really for good.
p	Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond has been a rebooting of the 007 franchise, as a young Bond becomes a mature agent.  "Spectre" is the end of that narrative arc.  In this outing, Bond's opponent is a man whose name will be familiar to long time fans of the franchise. The movie opens with a terrific action sequence in Mexico, set on the Day of the Dead.  Bond is off on a private mission, while MI-6, in the fallout from "Skyfall", is facing termination.  With help from Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw), Bond will doggedly pursue a trail of clues to a young woman who may have  some of his answers.  Together, they will find and face an old acquaintance who is the head of a very evil and very powerful organization. The movie has a story, and plenty of action sequences, one after another.  The movie's subtheme, about the power of information and its misuse, is very topical, and the villain himself is urbanely, cheerfully nasty.  There is a worthy evil henchman to be fought, an exciting car chase sequence in Rome, after dark, and an even better chase sequence in the Austrian Alps.  Highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the franchise.
p	I am shocked and appalled at the negative reaction to this movie. Let me preface this review by saying, if your style of action movie is something like "Furious 7" you may have no interest in Spectre. Lets start from the beginning. Just because you don't understand a movie, doesn't mean it's not good. There are many reasons you might not understand this movie, if you're not a real Bond fan and are just looking for a good popcorn flick, this may not be for you. It's not really a multitasking movie, if you weren't paying attention, or were anticipating being force-fed the plot that would explain as to why you were lost. What makes a Bond movie? What are the factual elements that comprise a James Bond film? 1. The cars. Spectre uses the all new (and Bond modified) Aston Martin DB10 and it is an absolute monster. There are several adrenaline pumping chase scenes in the movie (another Bond staple) that should keep you entirely enthralled. If that isn't enough wait til the end. 2. Bond girls. Spectre features not 1, but 2 Bond girls (although one with significantly less screen time). First you have Italian born actress Monica Bellucci, and next (the real Bond girl) you have the gorgeous Parisian Léa Seydoux, who not only looks good but was great for that role. 3. The gadgets. A lot of older Bond fans (specifically Moore fans) may be salty about the fact that the Craig-Bond doesn't use a ton of silly gadgets in his movies. While Spectre continues that trend, it is also not completely devoid of any Bond gadgets. 4. The attire. Like Skyfall, the production and costume design for Spectre was mesmerizing. Specifically for James Bond, who was outfitted in every scene courtesy of Tom Ford. There was not one shot in the film that he wasn't dressed to impress (unless otherwise intended). 5. The Bond. This is one that can not be changed, if you don't already know by now Daniel Craig IS James Bond. Everybody has their favorites but he is who he is and that isn't going to change unless he does indeed decide that Spectre was his last entry (which I don't think he will). So to recap, the movie literally hit on everything that a James Bond movie is (and has been for over 50 years) and should be.
p	To start this review off I'd like to say that Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond. Even though I am a classically trained Bond fan. I grew up with Connery films and I love the entire franchise. Craig's films overall though have been far and away my favorite. The reviews for this latest entry though had been mixed so my expectations were a bit lowered. To put it simply though Spectre blew me away. Daniel Craig once again nails the character perfectly. If this is his final bow as the character he ends on a high note. His performance is just incredible. The Bond Girl this time around is played by Lea Seydoux known for her performance in Blue is the Warmest Color. It's the first love interest since Eva Green's Vesper Lynd in Craig's first outing, and the relationship is well handled. It feels real and not tacked on to fill the beautiful woman quota. The film follows Bond's path of discovery as he fights to learn the truth behind a mysterious evil organization. Now this may sound like a familiar plot point for a Bond film, but it is done with expert execution. The organization is run by a man that just might have a past with James. Their story is an excellent emotional ride that does a great job of tying all the previous Craig films together. I recommend that if you haven't seen his other films, or it's been a while you should see or get a refresher before you see Spectre. There are many nods and references made to his other films and overall Spectre won't have the same impact if you hadn't seen his other movies. Also clocking in at almost two and a half hours Spectre is James Bond's longest outing. However the pace is so well done it never feels like it overstays it's welcome. The action in the film is very well constructed yet again by Sam Mendes. It actually includes the largest explosion ever filmed according to Guinness. The reliance on practical effects is always a welcomed sight. Even away from the action Mendes has a great eye and it makes the film visually stunning. Whether it is the city of London, on ski slopes in the Alps, or in Rome the sequences are beautiful. Part of the opening scene is comprised of a long one take that was a nice touch and I loved it. Sam Smith recorded the song "Writings On The Wall" for the movie. It connects to the movie much more than a regular Bond theme and I loved it. I never thought that I would say this, but if this is Craig's final Bond film I am content with that. It so expertly puts a bow on Craig's Bond, and could act as a perfect conclusion.
p	UPDATE (08.02.2016): Shipping has begun for "SPECTRE"'s Feb. 9th blu-ray release. I got the steelbook from BestBuy, which is a single disc edition. Single, and 2-disc steelbook blu-ray editions feature the bullet-hole image, which seems like it's universal and will vary slightly depending on which site you purchase it from (photos 1-3 show the French, German, UK and US editions, as examples). The same goes for the content: standard single disc blu-ray editions feature the film along with a HD digital copy, whereas standard 2-disc editions feature the film, a HD digital copy, and an extra DVD with the bonus features. Standard single, and 2-disc amaray editions, feature cover artwork from the film's official poster, with Daniel Craig wearing a white tuxedo (photos 4-6). Each edition indicates whether it's a single or 2-disc package. The bonus material may also vary slightly, but it is basically what is listed below. All versions come with a slipcover. As far as the steelbook packaging is concerned, the surfaces are glossy and flat, just like the previous 3 Craig-steelbooks (with only the bullet-hole image embossed on both sides, no title fonts etc.). Picture quality is nothing short of stunning (there is such an amazing detail, it's unbelievable), and the sound is a work of art (there's always something going on even on the quiet scenes). Only gripe is the few extras, hugely disappointing for a Bond fan, especially following the generous "Skyfall" package. List of contents: Aspect ratio: 2.38:1 Audio: English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit), English: Dolby Digital 5.1, French: Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1, Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1 Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese Total run time: 182' (feature film - 148', bonus features - 34') Extra features: SPECTRE: Bond's Biggest Opening Sequence (20:12) Video Blogs (9:09): Director Sam Mendes / Supercars / Introducing Lea Seydoux and Monica Belucci / Action / Music / Guinness World Record Theatrical Trailers (5:18) Photo Gallery Target edition bonus features: From Title Song to Title Sequence (6:28) The Shadow of SPECTRE (10:15) "Writing's on the Wall" music video (4:46) Following on from arguably the most fascinating, and evidently the most successful instalment in Bond history, "SPECTRE" is destined to be compared to "Skyfall"'s colossal impact. Cleverly enough, director Sam Mendes turns those expectations by opting for a less risky, but equally ambitious choice, thus, to employ every trick in the Bond book onscreen in order to remind us why we love 007. The basic plot sees the 00 programme coming under threat from a merger between MI5 and MI6, as Bond has to disobey orders and strike out on his own against SPECTRE (=Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). It gets very complicated as the fiilm progresses, so it's wise not to say anything more. The 4-word epigraph that begins the film ("The dead are alive"), and the pre-credits set piece (Bond in masked skeleton costume in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead), set the tone early. "Skyfall" told a different type of story, and spent its last half taking Bond home. There is a hangover from that personal story angle in "SPECTRE" in a backstory that links Bond's unhappy childhood with the creation of SPECTRE. This derivative nature of the relationship between Bond's past and present, and his troubled personality are explored rather extensively. Fortunately "SPECTRE" does not forget to have fun, too. After all, this is what 007 movies are supposed to be. In terms of the series trajectory, "SPECTRE" is a place-holder. Awesome stunts (a couple of eye-popping scenes), extravagant locations (Mexico, Rome, Morocco), diabolical villains (the most personal Bond villain yet), gorgeous Bond girls (special mention for the divine Monica Bellucci), amusing references to previous films (there's even a white fluffy cat re-emerging), an extended plot (involving digital surveillance), excessive running time (at 148 mins, this is the longest Bond film). Really, this is a celebration of everything Bond. Stylistically, "SPECTRE" looks and feels like a modern action movie. Technically, the superb craft contributions demonstrate how the franchise's bar has been raised over the last decade. All actors are on top form; S. Mentes really is a master at getting the best out of his performers. Naturally, his protagonist steals the show; confident, brutal, practical, serious, witty, Daniel Craig goes the full Bond. What is missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of "Skyfall". "SPECTRE" sees Bond forced into the shadows; at times even his masculinity is called into question. But, the emotional intensity of "Skyfall" was so powerful, that inevitably is impossible to match. Other than that, "SPECTRE" is all one could possibly want from a Bond film. In many ways this is the purest Bond experience of the Daniel Craig era. Less demanding in terms of acting, Craig's 4th - and perhaps his last, as rumoured - outing relies more on the series iconography for 007's forward momentum. Even the much talked-about Sam Smith theme song, "The writing's on the wall", contributes towards that. Though not as bold, dramatically rich or emotionally compelling, "SPECTRE" still ranks as a sleek, pulse-pounding entertainment. If this will actually prove be the last Bond for both Daniel Craig and Sam Mentes, they can at least depart, leaving the series stronger than how they found it. Re-embracing all the traditional elements, "SPECTRE" is a glorious realisation of Bond's cinematic heritage.
p	I thought this movie was good, enjoyable fun in the theater and will purchase it for my collection once it is released. Basically, what I'm looking for in a Bond film is just some silly escapism.  I recognize that some people are put off by the implausibility of the stunts or the plot.  With some movies, that is a bigger deal to me than it is with others.  When I go to a 007 movie, I really just want to have fun.  Spectre, I thought, did a nice job of allowing its audience to just sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy themselves. A great many shots in the film are homages to earlier Bond films.  It was part of the fun to see those shots and recognize something or some connection to the earlier films. I found the casting and acting to be largely satisfying.  The one exception to that was Lea Seydoux.  She didn't do anything wrong; she just seemed an implausible romantic connection for Bond.  An older actress would have been a better choice, in my mind. The action is fast-paced, fun, interesting, and timely.  The major formulas from Bond films that fans have grown comfortable with and expect to see are all here. The one thing I would classify as a disappointment was the reintroduction of Blofeld.  Christoph Walz does a nice job with the role, but the motivation for Blofeld's existence and actions ultimately falls flat.  A truly diabolical character from the early films is reduced to a petulant child seeking some sort of retribution for what seems like a fairly minor episode from decades earlier.  Not only did it make little sense that the script's motivation for Blofeld was what it turned out to be.  It was completely nonsensical that he would be able to amass a vast, secretive, international criminal conspiracy in order to avenge this irritant from the man's childhood.  Why would the others go along with it? This failing is not crippling to the film, though.  After all, few Bond villains make sense when you consider them and their lairs.  They're live-action cartoon characters.  However, this one was unfortunate because the wounds to the plot were self-inflicted.  This film--as has become common with series installments of this generation--decides it is important to explore the characters' backstories, to understand the motivations behind them, and to humanize them.  Then, the backstory for this most consequential Bond villain is clumsily outlined and--ultimately--is unsatisfactory in telling us about Blofeld.  It does tell us that the screenwriters and director would have been better off leaving the question alone. Much better would have been to just have Blofeld back.  He's trying to do something big like the character used to do.  Instead, his story shows him to be roused to a fury out of any proportion to the injury the screenplay gives him. If you ignore the motivations of Blofeld, though, the film is a fun installment in the series.  I had no problem with it because I always ignore the characters' backstory that is given in these more modern adaptations.  I don't care what their motivations are.  I want to see the elements of a Bond film and have some fun.  This film largely gives us that.  If this was Mr. Craig's farewell to the role, it was a good way for him to depart the stage.  If he does return (and I hope he does), this film does allow for that possibility pretty easily if the writer and director will stick to what has made 007 great this last half century.
n	After the back-to-basics grit of Skyfall, I had very high hopes for Spectre. Could NOT have been more disappointed. I almost fell asleep twice during this film, as Craig routined pretty much everything. I'm sorry to say, but the sheer magnitude of Spectre - in the end - was such a letdown - so easily defeated and only a few guards left as Craig ran outside. Really? That was IT? Just a sleepwalk piece - shoddy script, phoned-in directing, stiff and cliched action scenes. I was happy when the movie and the boredom was over.
n	Just totally disappointed. The director has the best James Bond in decades (Daniel Craig) and had no idea what to do with him. The movie was comic and choppy. You literally jumped from one scene to another and were left wondering why is Bond here and how did he figure out how to even go to this location for the next really bad camera work. Just totally sucked. So disappointed.
n	I missed Spectre in the theater, and was so looking forward to it when it came out on blu-ray. I'm surprised to say this, but this was one awful movie and it has nothing to do with Daniel Craig. First off, let me say that I've loved the past three Bond films. They were a refreshing update to the series, and Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond harkened back to the physical, brutal, damaged spy in Sir Ian Fleming's novels. I'm even a fan of Sam Mendes. But after a pretty terrific opening scene, the film went down the toilet fast. It just felt "off" throughout, lacking any sense of dramatic tension or excitement or... anything. I first cringed when Bond "seduced" a "grieving" Monica Bellucci -- it made no sense and was downright icky. And there were more cringes and long bouts of boredom to come. The final showdown(s)? Christoph Waltz was completely wasted as the villain, almost comically so. The reason for his villainy didn't bother me as much as it was so casually treated as a throwaway. Well, if I hadn't been given the disc by my wife for Valentine's Day, I would have literally thrown it away. Anybody want to buy it used from me cheap? Hands down the worst movie of 2015, and I liked many others, including Fury Road, Spotlight, Ex Machina. Who would have thought Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation would be the best Bond movie of the year (especially for femme fatale, Rebecca Ferguson!).
n	I consider myself as one of the biggest Bond fans out there. Read some of the Ian Fleming's books and been following Bond films as a kid since Connery days. It was a high point in the franchise when Craig took the Bond mantle. Sad part is what Sam Mendes has done to the franchise with SPECTRE! Somebody rightly said it seemed as if the filmmakers had a check list to do all the things Bond; a lavish opening scene, beautiful women, flashy cars, exotic locations, action in snow, action in train, evil villain, grand lair, explosions, etc. In the excitement of ticking all the boxes they forgot to develop a script. Every scene, every act is disjointed. In the opening sequence, why was Bond trying to kill the chopper pilot? Butista is mute and Spectre make him head of Mexico cartel? Bond escapes from a highly secret Spectre meeting and nobodys blocking the exit and only one man bothers to follow him. Senseless car chase where Bond is so scared of one guy who is not even shooting at him that he dumps a top secret vehicle in the river of a foreign country and escapes. Bellucci is totally wasted. When the baddies kidnap Seydoux why Bond chases them in a plane instead of a car or a jeep? In the train how come Bond and his girl are travelling with such extravagant wardrobe? Poor attempt to link Blofeld to Bond's childhood. Very poor attempt. Waltz, a great actor, totally wasted as Blofeld and was treated like a very weak henchman let alone the head of the most evil organization? Bond escapes from him and hardly finds anybody stopping him, one shot at the pipes of the grand structure and everything explodes! The less said about the climax the better. The whole film is a drag and a big disappointment. I wish Craig left the franchise on a high. Even he looked bored in the film. Another reboot expected soon.
n	The previous Daniel Craig Bond films have had a certain feel that the previous incarnations didn't. They were grittier, a Bond for the modern times, culminating in SKYFALL, which wasn't just a good Bond film, but a good movie overall. Sam Mendes, the director of SKYFALL, returns with SPECTRE, but he leaves his personal touch behind. SKYFALL was so good because something was at stake; it was personal. SPECTRE pretends to be personal; the film has Bond following a mission from beyond the grave, which ultimately leads him into his own past and facing his most personal enemy yet. But...the thing is, there's nothing at stake. There's no real character development. In fact, the two characters who have the most at stake are minor characters--Ralph Fiennes' M and Ben Wishaw's Q. You can even see the two actors collaborating over tea beforehand: "Hey, our characters are the most interesting. Wanna have fun with this?" That's not to say that there isn't anything to enjoy here. SPECTRE has that old Bond feel, and it's fun. Daniel Craig is solid as always (he was even good in QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which we don't like to think about). Christoph Waltz is always welcome, although his talent is wasted; he's a great actor, but he doesn't have much to work with. Dave Bautista, as the silent henchman Hinx, is a scene-stealer, and Monica Bellucci makes a great Bond girl (about time; and the heck with those who think age matters in this regard). There are some great action scenes and one-liners; you know, the things that go with the classic Bond films. Problem is, there's a reason they revamped the franchise. There's nothing wrong with the Connery/Moore films (well, most of them); but that James Bond is a bygone character for a bygone age. SPECTRE feels dated and somewhat tired. It really makes you just want to watch an older Bond film instead. As such, it's hard to enjoy it for what it is. If I want classic Bond, I'll watch classic Bond. I look to Mendes/Craig to give me something modern, something edgy. SPECTRE doesn't do that. It'll please some, and if you enjoy the series then it's definitely worth watching. But a Bond film starring Craig and Waltz, and directed by Sam Mendes, could've been so much more.
p	I've had many versions of this perennial favorite. Heck, right now I have three versions of the studio release of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon alone. The original CD version, the 30th Anniversary hybrid SACD and, this, the new 2011 remaster. Although I have yet to hear the MFSL rendition, to me this is the best effort to date for a DSotM CD. For one thing, thankfully, they didn't compress the music. It's seems to level match fairly well with the other Dark Side CDs I have. Clarity seems to have improved also. It's so clear that it makes the others seem a bit muddied. The great part is not etched. Meaning it sounds smooth while the music is very well defined. The noise floor seems to be lower on the 2011 remaster than either the original or 30th Ann. That makes the music more dynamic with the quieter background. Overall the improvements of the 2011 remaster of DSotM are worth getting. The sound differences may not be dramatic but are certainly audible and make this classic even better. That's only half the story though. The Experience edition comes with the '74 live performance of this great album. THIS is what makes paying the small premium over the Discovery edition well worth it. Not only are the boys in terrific form giving an outstanding show (much better than the Pulse show 20 years later) but the sound quality is amazing. If the original studio version weren't so well known and this 1974 concert album were released years earlier, this could almost have become the definitive version. Highly recommended just for this CD alone. Add the well done 2011 remaster and it deserves a 5 star rating.
p	Studies have been conducted on the success of Pink Floyd's classic, best-of-the-best "Dark Side of the Moon."  Some results are as follows: *One in every 20 people under the age of 50 in the United States owns a copy of this album *Dark Side remained on Billboard's 200 album chart for an amazing 15 years straight and then for another two when it was remastered back in 1994 *It is currently the most successful album ever with upwards of 40 million copies sold world-wide Now the question... WHY?  Why should one album by a band back in 1973 have such outstanding achievments and admiration even today?  Perhaps because of the time period.  Look at other albums released the same year by bands like Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Rush, and the Doobie Brothers among several others.  This was the year of rock perfection.  Or maybe it was because of the rave for concept albums.  Or the simple, yet unforgettable album cover. More likely it was the band's chemistry and ability to make jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking music.  This is Pink Floyd at its collective finest, with everyone contributing.  Unlike the band in 6 years, Waters did NOT do everything.  Gilmoure took a huge chunk of the music-writing, laying down the chord progressions on "Breathe," "Time," and "Any Colour You Like;" the singing on the album's best songs, Water's conceeding to David's far superior voice; and pumping out what would later be hailed as some of rock's most influential lead-guitar riffs on "Money" and "Brain Damage."  Wright got in on much of the writing as well with his keyboard contributions on "Breathe," the symphonic "Great Gig in the Sky," "Us and Them," and the amazing keybpard licks and effects on "Colour."  Mason, who rarely contributed, put in his efforts on "Speak to Me," "Time," and the Waters-less "Colour."  Finally, Roger Waters put down most of the album's music, laid down all the bass-lines as usual, thought up the album's concept, and wrote all the lyrics.  If that's not enough, he made himself heard on "Brain Damage," "Eclipse," and the chorus of "Time."  Anyway you put it, THIS is the true Pink Floyd; all contributing, all acknowledged. The band's titanic success was continued on later albums like 1975's "Wish You Were Here," 1977's "Animals," and 1979's "The Wall," although by that time the band had begun to fall apart from Waters' power obsession.  By 1983, the band had slipped to a Water's-solo-project version of itself, with "The Final Cut," and finally a break-up.  But never would the band see the success or experience the musical genious of "Dark Side of the Moon."  So pop this in, take another listen, and remember- even if you don't believe the hype- after this album, music would never be the same....
p	So here it is... the Dark Side 'Immersion' set.  This is the fifth version I've owned of the legendary album, and I would have been happy to own just the Blu-Ray disc alone here, but of course it is not available separately.  That said, I'm happy to own Disc 6, the 'Extra Audio Tracks,' mainly for the Alan Parsons Mix.  It's interesting to hear for historical value.  The various ephemera, marbles and so on, are kinda fun, but I'm not the type of collector who looks for such items. As for the music, the Quad Mix sounds entirely fantastic on the Blu-Ray disc. Regarding the central Dark Side version of this reissue, the James Guthrie 2011 remaster, I really cannot detect any difference between this and the 2003 remaster that was done for the 30th anniversary of Dark Side.  Perhaps my listening mind is too taken up in the details of the amazing yet ultra-familiar album experience to notice any subtleties.  The Wembley '74 live album, which I'm listening to as I write this, is a solid concert representation of the album.  The sound quality is very good considering the age of the recording.  The additional video concert footage is all relatively good, though some of it suffers a bit from poor camera angles and slightly muddy sound mix. The documentary here is more of promotional vehicle, brief but moderately informative.  The 'Classic Albums' story on Dark Side is really a much more thorough and interesting dissection of the album's creation and would have been a better addition to this set.  I guess the business arrangements for that were too difficult or something. Packaging-wise, this is not the most well organized box set, as opposed to something like the Pixies box.  There are slots for Discs 1-4 built into the set, but everything else is just loose.  Discs 5 & 6 (including the Blu-Ray disc, to me the most important item) are in cardboard sleeves, but there are no designated slots for them within the box.  They're just dropped in with everything else.
p	This new remaster of Dark Side of the Moon is a wonderful sonic treat. The subtle sound effects and rich tapestry of sound is now surrounding you in DSD 5.1 glory (if you have an SACD player) and the clarity is outstanding. I read where they went back to some original "un-pre-mixed" tracks that hanever been heard "first-generation" by any of us before. Very nice... ...BUT... I have a few beefs, some minor, some major. 1. The song breaks are in the wrong places. Generally they take you not to the next track, but a few seconds before the real song break takes place. It's REAL aggravating. Oops... 2. The mix seems to me to be subtly different from what I'm used to (I never had the 92 remaster, only the original LP and CD releases) and in some cases, I'm afraid it's noticably different (inferior?) Most notably is "Great Gig in the Sky" where the wonderful vocal solo is relegated to the background, fighting for attention with the organ. This is somewhat mitigated by the surround mix, but on a standard CD player it was noticable, and a little irritating. Since I do a lot of listening in the car, I'm just not sure I wouldn't prefer the original CD to this there. Or I guess I could just burn the old vinyl copy onto CD (see below) 3. I'm sorry, but the title of this album is "Dark Side of the Moon", not "THE Dark Side of the Moon" as it says on the spine of this reissue. Serious proofreading error, imho. Maybe it's intentional, to distinguish? 4. Nice new cover art, but the original was perfect. I wish that the book had been reversible, so you could have the original cover image. (btw, I didn't like the change they made in 92 either) I know it's nitpicking, but back in the days when album art was 12" square it wouldn't have been. Ultimately, it's worth getting if you're a fan of the album, and if you're not a fan of the album...what is your problem? But to my ears, as a CD, this does not surpass the High-quality Vinyl Original Master Recording from Mobile Fidelity that I listened to in the 80s (on a really good turntable and stereo). Unless of course, you must have surround. And if you must, you MUST hear this. The 5.1 mix is exhilirating, and not as obnoxious and "un-musical" as others I've heard. I give it 4 stars, because the SACD portion definitely gets 5, and the CD gets about 3, so I split the difference.
p	The problem with some albums (most of The Beatles' catalogue, Zeppelin, Radiohead, etc) is so much has been written about them there's not a lot new to say.  For DARK SIDE OF THE MOON I figured I'd examine the record more in the context of their catalogue overall, as this is not very often examined in Amazon reviws. As I've said in other reviews, Pink Floyd has always been a weird band.  There's a reason why they're considered the ultimate space-rock band.  And while there are other albums in their catalogue that are even spacier and more strange than the perennial favorite DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (ATOM HEART MOTHER and PIPER AT THE GATES OF DOWN, to name but two), it is here, on this album, that the band trimmed back their wild experiments to manageable songs.  And once the general public figured out what Pink Floyd was capable of, they bought the record in droves. Pink Floyd has a sizeable catalogue that dates before DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  While the Pink Floyd Faithful know these albums, a lot of fans don't know these records, and if they go looking for another DARK SIDE, they are often puzzled at the music they do find.  There's a reason for that. Pre-1973, Pink Floyd was very much on the outer edges of rock music.  Like The Grateful Dead, they played by their own rules, and invented and subverted their own musical forms into something druggy, ethereal, and far beyond the scope of any normal popsong.  Listening to early Pink Floyd records is like an audio-acid trip, and it's surprising that not only did they get to release such experimental music, with no real chance of getting radioplay or singles, but they got to release so many albums of it.  With today's market and expectations and pro-tools mentality of the quest for the perfect popsong that will be the next big hit, the early PF records would never have been released. All this changed in 1972, when Pink Floyd released their criminally underrated soundtrack OBSCURED BY CLOUDS.  The true precursor to DARK SIDE, OBSCURED was recorded just as the initial sessions for DARK SIDE began.  Moving away from the side-long suites and long winding instrumentals, OBSCURED features 10 songs, only four of which are instrumentals, with the other six songs being very akin to the DARK SIDE songs.  It is with OBSCURED that Pink Floyd began writing music that would be much more accessible to the general record-buying public. Pink Floyd continued in the direction they began with OBSCURED BY CLOUDS.  Streamlining their music, Pink Floyd forwent the rather bizarre experiments that made up the bulk of their previous work.  But don't think they sold out.  Everything in DARK SIDE has precedent in their previous work. While there's nothing that truly sounded like DARK SIDE in 1973, the music sounds very much like a culmination of all their previous experimentation (not counting Barret's PIPER) dating from 1968 to 1972.  But rather than let their audio love of sound effects get away with them ("Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast"), or draw their often fascinating instrumental music to gargantuan proportions ("Echoes", "Atom Heart Mother") that only prog fans will wade through, the band took the elements of their overall sound, streamlined it, and used much more accessible songwriting, but still being true to their artistic vision. And it is a vision and a sound that a lot of people love.  DARK SIDE epitomizes what the band was capable of.  Filled with sound effects, spacey music, turbocharged [turbocharted] instrumentals, DARK SIDE takes elements from all of the band's previous albums and utilizes them here.  A lot of the sound effect work is rather famous, especially the interview snippits that engineer Alan Parsons and the band sprinkled throughout the album.  Paul McCartney was interviewed, but seasoned by years of media coverage, the band felt his answers were too guarded and not as off-the-cuff as they wanted.  The "I'm drunk" line was by Henry McCullough.  There's also a barely audible orchestral version of The Beatles "Ticket To Ride" that can be briefly heard at the end of "Eclipse". Pink Floyd always had the potential to be not only great musicians and rock artists but also commercially.  But let's not kid ourselves.  Without DARK SIDE, they would not be the commercial juggernauts that they have become today.  Had they broke up with OBSCURED, today Pink Floyd would be one of those cult bands that a lot of people haven't heard of, but that those who do know them find them very interesting. And that is why DARK SIDE is their definitive album, and one of the biggest selling albums ever.  It is here on DARK SIDE that Pink Floyd went from being beyond a cult band with some rather esoteric, rather impenetrable music, to being a very successful band with the same sonic identity, but more streamlined and much more accessible to the general pubic. (As far s the whole Dark Side of the Rainbow phenomena goes, where Wizard of Oz and the album syncs, apparently it is unintentional, or so the band claims.  Pretty bizaare how well they sync if indeed it is unintentional).
n	Being a Pink Floyd fan, I have purchased every version of this album since it was released 30 years ago. By far the best version is the SQ Quadraphonic LP version, but as far as the stereo mix goes, the original UK Harvest CD (made in Japan) is still the high point. Ten years ago, the fine engineer Doug Sax made a valiant effort, but it is clear listening to that XXth Aniversary Edition CD that the original tapes no longer have the same dynamics they originally had (magnetic analog storage slowly loses it quality). Nevertheless, I decided to give this new 30th Anniversary CD a try.  I should mention here that this is only a review of the standard stereo tracks - I don't yet have an SACD-capable player. However this release doesn't make me want to run out and buy one.  My worst fears have been realized as once again, the overall mix of the album has been lost in favor of "resolving power", ie the ability to hear little details.  The problem is that after applying techniques to bring out such details, the engineers have done nothing to restore the original mix of the album. The result is like a starving artist's copy of a Rembrandt painting - it sounds something like Dark Side of the Moon, but when you hear the real thing, you realize that it is only a faded imitation. The problem is that few people these days have access to what it actually sounds like.  Almost no one listens to their LP versions, and only a handful of people are lucky enough to own the original UK Harvest CD.  Furthermore, it seems clear that the engineers of this 30th Anniversary Edition haven't listened to the original, either. Interestingly, the original engineer, Alan Parsons, asked to be involved in this 30th Anniversary Edition project, but was shut out.  It would seem that future listeners suffer as a result. PS  My qualifications:  I am a California state certified Studio Recording Engineer.  One of my instructors was the original engineer for the drum recordings for "Dark Side of the Moon".  I compared the 30th Anniversary Edition, XXth Anniversary Edition, and UK Harvest CDs using AKG K240 Studio Monitor headphones (as used in many studio recording situations over the past 20-30 years).
n	If you give a damn about sound quality, DO NOT buy this vinyl.  EMI has done an insulting job of transferring what could arguably be called "the greatest album ever recorded" onto the vinyl medium.  Now I'm not an audiophile whack job with a $15k turntable and pure gold speaker cables.  But even I can tell the difference between what sounds like someone eating a mouthful of pop rocks with their mouth open [this album,] and quality quiet vinyl.  This vinyl is incredibly noisy, and I was surprised by the quantity of surface defects that spanned multiple grooves, resulting in recurring "shchh" noise with every rotation of the record for up to a minute at a time [including at the beginning of The Great Gig in the Sky, of all places!]  I was planning on purchasing EMIs new releases of Wish You Were Here and The Wall on vinyl too, but not any more. I love Dark Side of the Moon and have it in several formats already.  If you love this album too, do not purchase this version.  Instead, seek out a used copy of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's vinyl pressing from 1979.  My 32-year-old MFSL copy puts this new edition to shame.
n	Listened to this on a high end VPI turntable - same experience as other reviewers - noisy, pops & ticks throughout, and an audible scratch that lasts about 1/4 of the way through side 2. What are these people doing before putting the vinyl in the sleeve. Advertised as audiophile? - NOT!
n	Pink Floyd has consistently been a band greatly concerned with preserving the integrity of its catalog.  Although "The Dark Side of the Moon" has been subject to frequent remasters and reissues, the band has never before included outtakes, alternate takes, or demos. So I was quite surprised by the announcement of these Immersion editions of three of the band's most cherished albums.  On the set for "DSOTM", you get the (yet again) remastered album, a full live performance, DVD's and a Blu-Ray of surround and quad mixes, DVD's of the films that were shown as part of the original concerts and...here's the bit that still gets my pulse going a bit faster...a CD containing an early mix of the album, as well as demos and alternate takes, and the first release of material from the long-fabled "Household Objects" sessions (albeit, only one song from that aborted album). Then I was a bit dismayed to learn about the other "value added" materials in the set.  Alongside a booklet of related artwork, and another of photographs taken on tour, there is a set of nine coasters (heh?), a scarf (what?) and a pouch containing three marbles (WTF?).  For a band whose legacy is carefully preserved to the point of solemnity (the only band I can think of whose catalog is treated with more museum--or mausoleum--type reverence is Joy Division), these trifles are trivial to the point of mockery.  Perhaps they are  trying to lighten the tone of their image with these artifacts, but these items are quite tacky and are, in the end, really "value minus" materials. Even more unfortunately, this lack of focus, and attention to quality and detail, runs through the overall construction of the set.  The aforementioned two booklets are quite large in page size (roughly 12" x 12"), but are both rather thin and, given they are not hardcovers, are a bit difficult to handle.  And there is a green ribbon divider that implies you can simply lift the ribbon to access the four discs lodged in the back of the box; however, the flimsiness of the booklets (and the unwieldily stack of combined miscellany) makes it almost impossible to access those discs without emptying the box of its other content. As for those four discs I mentioned, they are barely secured in shallow recesses within the back side of the box.  I was stunned to open the box the first time and discover all four discs lying lose under the other materials after they had dislodged at some point in shipping.  Disc 1 was scratched but playable, but it just as easily could have been scratched beyond repair.  And, at this price, the discs should have been secured firmly enough to prevent this, regardless. Also, this is six disc set, so why are the first four discs in these unreliable recesses within the cover, while the last two are in their own sleeves?  Once again, there is considerable lack of thoughtfulness that went into this package--failures of both form and function from a band that used to have impeccable design standards. So, while this set should have been something that one could proudly display on a coffee table, it is instead a largely useless ensemble with cheap trinkets that slightly damage the band's reputation for me.  That said, there is no faulting the audio and video materials here--those alone completely justify the price.  But those recordings deserve better than this box.  I know I can simply ignore or discard the marbles, scarf and coasters, but I can't ignore the lack of consideration that went into the design and construction of this set. And although I know the "Wish You Were Here" set will have similar accoutrements, I still want to ask the band to please not cheapen my deep and personal affection for that album with a set like this.  Whoever designed these Immersion sets seems to have lost their marbles, so could they please keep them out of the next sets, as well?
n	I love this album and have since a teenager. I first bought a new release of Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl several years ago and found the album full of pops and scratches.  Okay, I thought, it could have been my old turntable.  I decided to take the plunge again a month ago when I purchased a brand new high end turntable.  So I ordered another  Dark Side of the Moon album and guess what...pops and scratches .  This time I returned the album (Amazon has a very good policy) and asked for another album thinking this was an anomaly.  Guess what....same thing pops and scratches.  Where is the quality control?  I have vinyl albums 30 years old that sound better.  I would not recommend this vinyl edition of the album to anyone.
p	I have spent a large majority of my 22 years in the New Mexican sun, and while I have been very good about sunscreen the last couple of years the sun damage of my youth has caught up to me and I found myself with 3 forehead wrinkles and a scattering of freckles and sunspots. While it might seem insignificant to some I hate to think what I'd look like at 40 if I already have signs of aging. So I did a lot of research into proven wrinkle treatment and in my search I discovered something. There are millions, MILLIONS of products, home remedies, and concoctions that claim to prevent wrinkles, treat wrinkles, make them disappear, and do a number of other things. However the ONLY FDA APPROVED ANTI AGING INGREDIENT is the various strands of RETINOIDS. That doesnt mean that nothing else out there works, but it means that the only one that has enough strong scientific evidence to be considered a treatment for anti aging is products containing some type of retinoid. When you go to a dermatologist for wrinkle cream, you will very likely receive a prescription strength retinoid because it is proven to work. What are retinoids exactly and what is the difference between the various types? Retinoids are essentially vitamin A, their structures vary in each of the three generations but generally all the retinoids found in anti wrinkle creams are first generation. They are in fact natural ingredients found in plants and animals and we consume them in our daily diets. Researching the various types of retinoids for anti aging there are 3 things that pop up.: retinol, tretinoin, and retinoic acid. It took a while to decipher what each of them is and after reading a number of papers about them the short summary is this. Tretinoin is retinoic acid (its also known by its drug name Retin-A) and is the retinoid you will find in perscription cream. The difference between retinol and tretinoin (in relation to their usefulness) is simply their strength. Tretinoin is retinoic acid that is directly applied and effective where retinol is applied and your skin coverts it to retinoic acid to be used. One of the dermatologist articles I read said she recommends anyone who considers a tretinoin to start with a retinol so you can build up to the full strength. Retinol and Tretinoin have been found to treat a number of different skin conditions, including acne, wrinkles, stretch marks, and even some studies have been done on its effect on treating skin cancer. How it treats wrinkles. When its applied your skin has cells that synthesize the retinoic acid and it increases cell turnover, thickens the skin, increases collagen production, Stimulates blood vessels in the skin, and reduces sun spots. One thing to know though is if applied everyday results will not show for 3-6 months with best results in 6-12 months. So for everyone who says they've used it for a month and haven't seen results, they  haven't been using it long enough, remember sun damage and wrinkles took years and years to appear and are not going to be undone in a month. The way to apply the product is to spread evenly 30 minutes after washing your face, to ensure your face is completely dry. While I have found different reasons as to why it shouldn't be applied wet most articles say that it: decreases effectiveness, increases risk for side effects like dryness and pealing/scaliness, and one article says it doesn't matter if you apply it wet, but putting it on while your face is completely dry can't hurt. Retinoids also make your skin more sun sensitive, so sunscreen should be applied daily (which if your trying to undo sun damage and wrinkles anyway than you should be putting on sunscreen anyway to prevent even more damage) Now finally for my personal results. I started using this product every night around 4 months ago and I have noticed a difference. My forehead wrinkles have almost completely disappeared, my sun spots have faded, and even my acne scars are less noticeable. For the price and effectiveness I would recommend this product. The only reason I do not give this product 5 stars is simply because it advertises itself as a deep wrinkle cream, and as I only have fine lines I cannot gauge its effectiveness on deep wrinkles. I hope some of the information about gives you a little insight into retinoids, but please know this is only basic information gathered by an individual from various scientific articles. I am not a dermatologist and if I was to go into more detail about retinoids this review would be 10 times longer. If you want to know more you should do your own research and talk to your doctor.
p	The most important thing to know before buying this is that retinol is a serious chemical. Its skin clearing properties were first discovered over 80 years ago but it used to require a doctor's prescription. Why? Because like I said, it's serious stuff. ;) The version that's available in this tube isn't nearly as potent as what the pharmacy has. But it gets the job done. Retinol is one of the only chemicals that truly can reduce wrinkles. Most products can only claim to reduce "the appearance" of wrinkles. They work only by plumping up skin to make it look more flat and also hydrating it so lines aren't so obvious. But as soon as you stop using it, the wrinkles will return. Retinol actually can reduce wrinkles, and countless studies have confirmed it. But all great things come at a price. The downside of this miracle is that you'll turn into a vampire! Retinol makes the skin extremely sensitive to the sun. Some people experience burning after only being in the sun 15 mins. while using retinol. So once you start using this, you'll have to be much more conscious of your skin. Retinol is also pretty harsh. You may experience painful burning, redness, and itching after you start using this. It isn't RoC's fault, so don't get upset at them. It's the nature of retinol and the price you pay for youth. Once you adjust, you'll probably be fine unless your skin is too sensitive. If so, I think RoC offers a sensitive skin formula too, so I'd recommend that. Now that I've thoroughly terrified you, let me tell you the good news--- It works! I've been wearing it nightly for 30 days now and I already see subtle changes in my wrinkles. It takes 12 weeks to really see a difference but most people should see some kind of results within the first 4 weeks. The box mentions 4, 8, 12 weeks so it's a gradual cycle of improvement. 12 weeks probably sounds like a long time to most people, especially if you want instant results. But retinol is not a fly-by-night, gimmicky product. It's the real deal and it takes time to penetrate the layers of skin on your face and start working its magic. Give it time, be patient, and start out cautiously! I recommend a thin layer on a small patch of skin first, just in case you have a bad reaction to it. Good luck, and thanks to RoC for making one of the most readily available retinol products that you can buy without a prescription!
p	I love this product for fighting wrinkles, but it is so harsh.  I have sensitive/dry skin (which of course, shows wrinkles the most) and being of "that certain age,"  my skin is extra dry and sensitive.  I used this religiously, but ended up with my eyes almost sealed shut from a reaction to it and my skin burned, even when I limited my use to once or twice a week.  Got rid of the wrinkles, but also got rid of my skin!!  I won't give up using it, because it is amazing on wrinkles, but I recommend not using it every night - use it a couple of nights on, then a couple of nights off.  My face would be red after using it this way, but not burned.  A friend of mine recommended another skin care product - she's into organic - and told me to try Bel Essence (comes in an oil or cream, I used both - I've been buying it from their website but it's available here too)( Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz ).  This solved the reaction problem to Roc.  Not only did it help my skin in general, but using it with Roc - no burning, no bad reactions.  I talked to my doctor about it, and he told me that the natural oils in Bel Essence contain high amounts of Vitamin E and other nutrients that help the skin heal and stay healthy.  If you love Roc (and I am a HUGE fan), I recommend using Bel Essence with it, to get the good effects of Roc without the bad.  There are a lot of all natural skin creams out there, but this worked the best, and absolutely worked the best with Roc.  Not only does it keep the results from the retinol permanent, my skin kept getting better - lines and discolorations were still going away even when I reduced the number of times I used the retinol.  I swear by both products. Quick update - for Roc burns, I found that the Bel Essence oil Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural Organic Anti-Wrinkle Formula with Argan, Grapeseed and Sesame Oil works a little quicker in helping heal.  Probably because it is 100% oil without the ingredients to turn it into a cream.  So if Roc really burned your skin, the oil will help treat it more quickly. Another quick update - my skin is fabulous now.  Never thought it would look this good - the Roc has reduced my lines to minor marks that make up covers nicely, and my skin is soft, firm, and a lot brighter.  This is a GREAT combo.  I love the effect of the bel essence on my skin, the roc gets your skin to turnover faster, and the bel essence makes sure that the new skin is firm, smooth, soft and wrinkle free.  I can't believe that a natural product work work this well - I expect it from the roc which uses chemicals, but I am amazed that ingredients from nature can so completely change my skin and make me look years younger! Ok - so I just need to add another quick rave about the combination of roc and bel essence.  I had deep crevices across my forehead - GONE - only the tiniest of lines that are easily covered with makeup.  I now have NO LINES around my eyes, or on my upper lip.  This combination is amazing.  I've used the Roc alone for a long time and saw results, but when I added the Bel Essence, that's when I really saw results.  And permanent results.  I am so thrilled with my skin now!
p	I started using this about 2 years ago when I noticed lines that I should not have in my late thirty's.  I use it religiously every night before bed and within a couple months I noticed results.  I am skeptical of everything and research things before I buy... If that is what you are doing... I can tell you this is a good product. A bottle lasts me several months.  Very pleased.
p	I have been using this for a few years now and am happy with the results. With long-term daily use along with the RoC Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer I think anyone should be able to see results. It does not make every line/wrinkle on your face disappear 100% but  it will make them significantly less intense along with lightenning any dark spots.  I do not find a greasy and it absorbs quickly enough that I can lay my head on the pillow shortly after applying and not worry about it rubbing off on the linens. I stopped using this for about a year for some insane reason and one day I looked in the mirror and was horrified at the significant lines on my forehead and the much more noticeable crows feet around my eyes. Ugh! I immediately went back to the daily regimen of RoC. My skin feels smooth and tighter and those horrible looking lines have significantly diminished in appearance.  As with all skincare products somethings work better for some people than others. Considering I am over 50 years old and the only thing that will completely stop the aging process is plastic surgery which I'm not going to partake in, I am pleased with the results I get with my RoC. The product comes in different size tubes.  I have found the 1 ounce last several months for me. Looking back at my purchases of this product on Amazon, I only purchased 2–3 times a year Suggestion: stop using the product for about a week if you are going to have your Eyebrows waxed as the retinol thins your skin a bit and will make it more likely to burn if the wax is too hot.
n	After the third use I had red, raised, burned areas on my cheeks.  The burned areas flattened out the next day, but now my cheeks are swollen up to my eyes.  The areas that were raised and red initially now feel like sandpaper on my face.  I do expect the swelling to go away.  I am not sure how many days it will take as I have not used the product for 3 days now.  I do fear that the rough texture of my face will take much longer to go away, IF it does, in fact, go away.  I am worried and would advise anyone who braves using this product to try it on a very small, discrete area for a several days before they apply more liberally.  I wish I had never used this product.
n	At age 38, I noticed my face needed serious help. Constant breakout was followed by  sun damage, acne and scratch scars all over the face, then wrinkles were getting deeper. Discovering regimen including Genes cream helped out a lot. I bought this tube because of good reviews from Amazon. Wrinkles smoothed out first, then tone changed. After eight weeks, I noticed  the area of scars and size of pores were diminishing. After using Roc for nine weeks, I compared pictures of my face at two years ago(at age 38) and before Roc usage. There was simply no comparison. My skin tone is so much lighter that I had to change the whole makeup and wrinkles are much less noticeable. After 12 weeks of use: This product increased sun sensitivity to such a level that my skin was almost seared in January sun.This happened under SPF 60 sunblock and thick layer of Clinique even better foundation and almost powder.12 weeks of work all disappeared. I stopped using it and went back to Genes cream regimen.
n	I've read the reviews, with people raving about this product, so I'm sure it works for most people.  However, this is definitely one product you need to be careful with.  Test it over a weekend because if you are allergic, you are going to need the time to recover from it.  My mom bought it first and after a few weeks of use, she'd had the tingling and some redness that the product says are normal until your skin adjusts.  She didn't think anything about the cream until one day when she realized she was having a severe reaction to it.  Her face swelled up like a balloon, and you could barely see her eyes.  She took Benedryl in large doses to stop the reaction, and it took her about a week to look normal.  She did not get it near her eyes.  Her pharmacist said they are seeing lots of people with reactions to skin creams lately, so perhaps there is a new chemical that products are using.  Your reaction will depend on your individual tolerances, and there's no other way to know unless you try it. Since my mom is allergic to many things, and I am generally not, she gave the cream to me to try.  For two nights, I tried it on a small portion of skin on my chin, and I had no problems. On Friday night, I put it on my forehead, chin, and below the cheekbones, to test it on a larger area away from the eyes.  Wow, was my reaction different!  Saturday, my eyes were red and felt a bit warm, and they watered a lot. By that night, I didn't apply it again because my tongue and lips tingled, along with my hands, and I knew it was a reaction to the cream.  By midnight Saturday, 28 hours since I'd first applied it in a larger area, I was also getting out the Benedryl to stop the burning feeling.  I'm writing this about 6pm Sunday, and I still feel tingling in my face and hands and tongue, my face feels tender and warm, and the skin on my eyelids and under my eyes is bright red.  Believe me, I didn't get it anywhere near my eyes and I washed my hands after applying it. It is a shame some of us react this way, and there are some people who will say we didn't apply it right, or test it properly. I know that in my case, that isn't true. I'm not sure what is in it that would cause this kind of severe reaction, but it is up to you to try it for yourselves.  I'm not criticizing the product with my rating, but by rating it low, people might read a warning that could help them.  As I told my mom, when our faces were swollen up, they are right - we have no wrinkles!
n	Negative: FYI: IS TEST ON ANIMALS I copied this from a review site: examiner Cons: This contains ordinary formula found in most other eye creamsReduced amount of retinol reduces the benefits if this productThis product is tested on animals
n	This cream went on fine however after continued use over 3 days my skin was burnt. It started to peel on my cheeks. I do not have particularly sensitive skin so I would be wary of this product.
p	I absolutely swear by Dove, and with good reason. A few years ago I got hit with mid twenties acne in a way that wasn't quite bad enough for a ProActiv commercial, but definitely not something that I could ignore. I tried using Cetaphil and Neutrogena, but while good products, neither of these worked for my particular skin. My grandmother, of all people, told me that Dove bars are really good for your face and that I shouldn't bother with the more expensive face washes when I could get something better for a fraction of the cost. Well, you've got to listen to Grandma. I tried using it, and wow, it really made a huge difference in evening out my skin tone and fighting my acne. I didn't just stop with the Dove bar, even though it was heaven sent. I also started using TreeActiv Anti Acne & Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel & Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) which really helped with my acne. I've been using it three times a week for the past month alongside my Dove bar, and the improvements are incredible. My skin is clearer and it seems like it's more taut, and I've been having a lot less acne, and even some of the scars from old pimples are going away. Add this to the TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! I use for spot treatments and moisturizing, and I'm really stepping up my complexion game. I recommend the Dove bar for all of your basic face wash needs, and then add anything with tea tree oil to supplement the bar.
p	This is our Dove story. I’ve been using Dove on and off my whole life. As a kid my mom would alternate between Ivory and Dove and we never really gave it too much thought. And so as an adult I kind of cycled as well. Enter babies and of course I used liquid baby soap. Then the babies grew a little and I started getting them random liquid soaps. I have a boy and a girl. My son wanted Ninja Turtle soap, my daughter a princess soap (which smelled gross lol).  I bought these things without stopping to think why in the world would they NEED cute bottles of soap. They were not expensive, and that is probably why. My daughter has sensitive skin and mild eczema. For some reason, I kept wondering if strawberries or something in the bread were triggering this. And maybe diet has something to do with it, but I didn’t even consider that random soaps I knew nothing about were perhaps not helping? Then one day we read a book about a Soap Boat and I was like… hmm – let’s make soap boats! Because I had purchased so many Dove bars, that’s what I used. And the soap boats were in the bathtub (sinking because Dove doesn't float - Ivory does by the way.). And I started using the bar soap to wash the kids. I explained how this is big kid soap and we have to close our eyes when mommy is rinsing and we shouldn’t put our soapy hands in our eyes, and we don’t eat it and so on… And you know what? My daughter’s eczema seems to be a little better. Is it medicine? No. Is it better than random soap? Yes. And guess who isn’t buying cute bottles of cheap soap anymore? Isn’t it funny how sometimes we can get distracted by marketing campaigns and just going back to basics to those things that our family has used for years and years is the answer? Eczema runs in my family. No wonder my mom bought the soap that worked. About the product itself: I read a review with a complaint that this product has a scent.  And it does have a scent. It is a very mild soapy clean scent though. I am not sure how you make a soap without any sort of smell to it. It imagine that they did not add fragrance but the ingredients probably have a bit of a scent to them? It is working for us, so this does not bother me at all.
p	As a 501C3, non profit I use this product to provide water and showers to homeless in Nye county, Pahrump Nevada
p	I have very dry sensitive skin and I check the pH (with pH measuring strips) of any soap I use. Most soaps, even the expensive ones, have pH in the range 8-9.5, which means they are harsh on the skin and they strip off the natural acidic mantle. This soap has pH 7, which means its at the point of neutrality from the chemical point of view, and it is affordable. It cleans very well but does not dry the skin out. It is by far my favorite soap for the whole body and the only one I have been used in the past few years. I read some complaining about the short life span of these soap bars. Put them in the refrigerator for longer life.
p	I only use Dove soap, and have tried virtually all of the varieties of bar soap the company sells.  This is my favorite.  The fragrance is soft, vanilla-like, and the soap has a perfect foaming and rinsing consistency.  Highly recommended.  And Amazon's competitive price (lower than if you buy at Wal-Mart or K-Mart or Target), coupled with Prime free shipping, makes this a superb purchase.
n	Our baby daughter started suffering from either dermatitis or eczema a year ago - just a red bumpy rash - and unscented Dove was recommended by the pediatrician, pediatric dermatologist, and allergist. Unfortunately, they didn't know the manufacturer had changed the product formula. We really wish they had - it would have saved her a year of terrible itching its new formula caused. We didn't know the Dove doctors have been recommended for years was no longer the same product. A wild goose chase ensued. A change in her diet to Alimentum resulted in dramatic improvement after a milk allergy was diagnosed. However, small raised red patches and intense itching that caused frantic scratching to the point of bleeding soon became major issues; atypical eczema was diagnosed. Treatment until just a few days ago had been warm daily baths and unscented Dove, along with hydrocortisone 1% on spots and Cetaphil cream all over.  Children's Zyrtec did not seem to alleviate the itching, although it did help her sleep. A visit to a dermatologist and a prescription for Calcitrene did not help either. Only a physical barrier - footed PJs with both zippers and snaps, kept her from picking at her skin constantly. Quite by accident I used unscented Dove two weeks ago. I suddenly found myself having intense itching as well.  Could it be that my daughter was allergic to Dove too? It did make sense as Dove was used directly on her exposed areas, arms and torso, and she had her most intense and frantic itching episodes after her bath. We discontinued Dove immediately and her intense itching subsided overnight. What I didn't understand why I was suddenly was allergic to the new bars. After doing some research it turns out that Dove has discontinued the old Dove unscented bar along with the Dove for sensitive skin (the one with sweet almond oil - itself an allergen) and combined them into one bar, Dove Unscented for Sensitive Skin. In so doing, it's changed its main surfuctant and other ingredients. An online search revealed complaints about itchiness and the new Dove. One wbsite site in particular on the treatment of eczema has an enormous amount of information on detergents, soap and their effects on eczema - especially the change in Dove soap. It no longer recommends it for eczema. Please see the comments section for more information. Interestingly, itchiness and redness with the new formulation was brought up by a costumer in Dove's own website and no solution is given other than Customer Service's phone number. I've also found some mentions of another Dove ingredient, "Sodium tallowate" - tallow, sometimes derived from cattle - as sometimes causing a reaction in people with milk allergies, causing flare ups in acne and eczema.  Whether this too caused an allergic reaction in our daughter, I don't know. We thought our case was isolated. However, it's possible that the skin problems related to the new Dove may be more widespread. I hope this information helps as this change was done quietly by the manufacturer. We also found sweet almond oil in the Cetaphil cream she was prescribed - an allergen for anyone with a tree nut allergy. We stopped using it later and the remaining red raised patches she had also diappeared. Other changes that were recommended including a change to Tide Free - it didn't help my daughter but it healed my red, cracked hands, the result of doing laundry 2-3x a day with All Free. Granted, individual reactions to products vary but the new ingredients in Dove may be causing allergies rather than helping them. None of the three doctors consulted knew of the formula change in Dove nor realized that the "Dove + cetaphil" combo they were recommending were causing the very symptoms (itching and rash) they were trying to treat. It's possible parents may just assume it's ongoing eczema, just like they did. It may not be.

I suddenly found myself having intense itching as well. Could it be that my daughter was allergic to Dove? It did make sense as Dove was used directly on her exposed areas, arms and torso, and she had her most intense and frantic itching episodes after her bath. We discontinued Dove immediately and her intense itching subsided overnight. What I didn't understand was why I was suddenly was allergic to the new bars. After doing some research it turns out that Dove has discontinued the old Dove unscented bar along with the Dove for sensitive skin (the one with sweet almond oil - itself an allergen) and combined them into one bar, Dove Unscented for Sensitive Skin. In so doing, it's changed its main surfuctant and other ingredients - in other words, the Dove doctors have been recommending for years is no longer the same product. An online search revealed complaints about itchiness and the new Dove. One website site in particular on the treatment of eczema has an enormous amount of information on detergents, soap and their effects on eczema - especially the change in Dove soap. It no longer recommends it for eczema. Please see the comments section for more information. Interestingly, itchiness and redness with the new formulation was brought up by a customer in Dove's own website and no solution is given other than Customer Service's phone number. I've also found some mentions of another Dove ingredient, "Sodium tallowate" - tallow, sometimes derived from cattle - as sometimes causing a reaction in people with milk allergies, causing flare ups in acne and eczema. Whether this too caused an allergic reaction in our daughter, I don't know. We thought our case was isolated. However, it's possible that the skin problems related to the new Dove may be more widespread. I hope this information helps as this change was done quietly by the manufacturer. We also found sweet almond oil in the Cetaphil cream she was prescribed - an allergen for anyone with a tree nut allergy. We stopped using it later and the remaining red raised patches she had also diappeared. Other changes that were recommended including a change to Tide Free - it didn't help my daughter but it healed my red, cracked hands, the result of doing laundry 2-3x a day with All Free. Granted, individual reactions to products vary but the new ingredients in Dove may be causing allergies rather than helping them. None of the three doctors consulted knew of the formula change in Dove nor realized that the "Dove + cetaphil" combo they were recommending were causing the very symptoms (itching and rash) they were trying to treat. It's possible parents may just assume it's ongoing eczema, just like they did. It may not be. ** Update 4/13 ** As noted in my review above the allergen that caused my daughter's eczema was detergent - in this case, the surfuctants in Dove. We then found out that exposure to other sulfates, such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (the main ingredient in Johnson's Baby Bath Head to Toe Baby Wash) are huge triggers for eczema in general - not just my child (why don't doctors know this?!). They may also contribute to scalp eczema - important to know as most shampoos contain SLS. The solution is simple - avoid anything with detergents and/ or sulfates and switch mostly to soap-based products. These are way milder than what we've been led to believe by advertising. Please see comments section for alternatives to Dove and baby washes with SLS. ** Update 10/14 ** New types of treatment are available for eczema nowadays that have nothing to do with the traditional Dove & Cetaphil Combo, and are one step up from regular hydrocortizone 1% + moisturizer. My daughter, who still had mild dermatitis / eczema was recently prescribed "Locoid" (4 oz, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% by prescription only) which is applied twice a day; for bathtime a gentle no-sulfate soap is used (such as Luxo Creme soap) with warm water. For her hair and scalp, Ciclopirox shampoo 1%, every other day along with Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl oz in the days in between, left on for 5 minutes before rinsing well. Her skin cleared up COMPLETELY in a matter of days. Please note Locoid works by blocking the production of inflammatory chemicals prevents the swelling and redness, and preventing the itching and rash formation that can happen as a result of inflammation of skin conditions such as eczema. It should only be used under the care of a doctor and is not recommended for long-term use, especially in children.
n	The reason why I rate this a 1 star is because THE SOAP DOES HAVE A SCENT. It is false advertising to advertise something as "unscented" when it truly does have a scent. A soap that is truly scentless will have absolutely no smell; if you closed your eyes and someone held up this bar of soap, I would know it is there because I CAN SMELL IT. I am just disappointed in this product because it has a scent. The scent is OK smelling, but I wanted a product with no scent. Dove should indicate that this soap is "original scent" not "unscented". In the picture, I emphasized the unscented label on the package by underlining it with Sharpie marker.
n	This soap smells wonderful and has a creamy-like feel to it, but after using it for about 3-5days it began to irritate my skin and often left me feeling itchy all over.  Great effort but far from natural.
n	BEWARE!!!! NOT for sensitive skin!!! I was dying all summer because I was using THIS soap! Never had bad allergies, cramps, or flaky skin before using this product. I changed my whole routine (even gave up drinking things like milk and soda!) trying to figure out what was causing my allergic reaction. Then I bought a different non-dove brand of soap that came highly recommended Dial, and the rash instantly vanished in the shower and never reappeared again! So much for being non-allergic and helpful to sensitive skin. It made things 100X worse for me. I will not be buying this product again. Dove deserves a class action lawsuit for being misleading, harmful, and dangerous to their customers.
p	This product is wonderfully nourishing for the complexion with its high concentrations of DMAE and Vitamin C Ester. No question it freshens and plumps the skin and contributes toward accomplishing a healthy glow. If anyone expects Perricone products to remove fatty tissue or to dissolve deep folds, those are unrealistic expectations for any topical application. It may have been a mistake to have labeled this product as a "Face Lift." "Face Lift" cannot reasonably be taken literally. Of course it's not a surgical facelift. It will not cut away excessive skin or remove fatty tissue. No cream, lotion, or serum can do that. If one has skin that has lost luster and some elasticity, this product will make a difference. It will give one a "lift," as in a "boost," to the complexion. I see a significant difference in the texture of my skin in part thanks to the nutrients in this product.
p	Like the product.  Smells better than Cold Plasma, but works about the same.  It is hard to tell much difference for a woman my age (62) and an avid outdoor person and 32-year flight attendant.
p	Only after a few applications, I could (and especially my boy friend) definitely notice a difference in my skin!  Very highly recommended!
p	Did a before and after {three weeks} photo.  Made a serious difference to below the eye and forehead wrinkles of this 70 year old.  Just ordered my second bottle.  If you want to look younger and can afford it, buy one to try!  I'm very pleased that I did.
p	I personally love all of Perricone MD products.  This product is highly effective providing the skin with an instant look and feel of having had a face lift.  Another must have beauty product.
n	WARNING!!!  This is an UNETHICAL company that makes charges on your credit card without your permission.  I ordered directly from their web site, and they started billing me for large amounts of money for no reason.  They obviously had no permission from me to bill me very large amounts of money.  I tried calling them to complain, and as soon as the automated answering machine found out I wanted to contact their billing department, they automatically hang up the phone.  STAY AWAY from this company!!!  They will start putting HUGE bills on your credit card without your permission, and then it's just a hassle explaining to the credit card company that they are billing you without your permission.
n	If this product was like when I purchase it through stores, I would have given it 4 stars. I am not sure if it was old, watered down or what but it was not effective.
n	I haven't seen any difference and I  am very disappointed. I should be able to trust the claims from a physician.
n	I ordered this product along with several other Perricone items and it was a complete waste of time and money. The first shipment arrived without the Face Lift serum and it took a LOT of follow up to get it sent. The same thing happened with the second shipment, another item was missing. This stuff doesn't do anything. When I called to cancel my deliveries, it took 3 months - they kept sending them and billing me even though I refused the packages. The products definitely match the service...both awful!
n	I heard great media hype about this product.  It is a good moisturizer, but definitely nothing special given the price.
p	I have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since I was a child. When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt. One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, "Neutrogena T-Gel." I asked, "Is that a prescription?" "No," he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot. This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean. Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a "vacation" and use another shampoo to "liven up" my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it. Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab. When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching. If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!
p	This review is from the perspective of a black user. As a black person, I use T-Gel once a week. I would actually disagree with some of the comments by the most popular review here (by Shelley), but the basic sentiment is the same, i.e. this works wonders. I have tried seemingly everything for my scalp, and it seems I've had a variety of problems over the years--dry scalp, dandruff, scaling, etc. I had even been told by a hair stylist that I had ezcema, but then it seemed she told most of her customers that. My last problem has been, from as best as I can tell from my research, scaling, buildup and dandruff. My scalp would itch to the point of making it difficult to sleep at night for just feeling the urge to scratch. I had clumps of flakes in my scalp, and I could often feel them rising to the surface. It was an irritating sensation that made it seem as if something was crawling in my scalp. Usually, I'd put my fingers where the sensation was and feel either flakes forming (not completely above the surface, but I could feel them) or already there (i.e. could scratch them right off my scalp). It seemed like something always came out of my fingernails, whether it was flakes or white gunk. I've used Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, store Nizoral and prescription Nizoral (as well as other things I can't remember). I was using the new Selsun Blue (the greenish or blue see-through bottles with Aloe Vera/vitamins or whatever, 3% Salicylic Acid) before this and was having those problems mentioned above. T-Gel works better than all of those shampoos put together. I knew I had used T-Gel a long time ago but couldn't remember anything about how it worked except it smelled bad and dried my hair out (I also had different issues with my scalp back then). Still, I could see that everything in stores for dandruff/itch all had one of two or so active ingredients in them, which is partially why none of them would work for me. Neutrogena didn't have those ingredients, and I'd read so many people online say it worked for them. So I decided to try it again. The first usage, I followed the instructions which say to apply twice, basically. I didn't find that only a small application would do, at least not the first application (and therefore, I wouldn't say one $10 bottle lasts months). I had read a review before buying that said T-Gel lathers a lot easier the second application in a row, and I found that to be true. The first application was not terribly lathery, and I squeezed T-Gel from the bottle into my palm multiple times so that I could work it into especially troubled spots (um, basically everywhere) good. It did smell bad, but honestly I didn't really care and still don't, if it's going to work. I didn't let it sit for 3 mins or anything like that, but I just rubbed it in as good as possible. Then I proceeded to use what I normally use in my hair--no other shampoos, just a moisturizer and a conditioner/moisturizer. I did feel like the smell was following me around. I had my mother smell my hair and she said the only reason she noticed it was because I pointed it out. I kept trying to pinpoint what I smelled like, and I realized I just basically smelled like I had something medicated in my hair. If I remember correctly, Nizoral smelled similar to T-Gel, at least once my hair was done--not the smell in the shower. Later that same night, I laid in bed and started feeling that sensation like something's crawling in my scalp. I did like always and placed my fingers where the sensations were and in some of those spots I did feel scaling and flakes or clumps, generally trying to come up but a couple times were already up. My scalp did feel so clean, though--I have not felt it this clean in years, probably. There was just no buildup. However, there was still itching, just not as much as usual. The flakes and itching were definitely cut down and the itching probably was more similar to what the average person goes through with their scalp. The second time I used T-Gel, there were no flakes at all for that whole week, at least not from dandruff--probably more from dry scalp, i.e. T-Gel does make your hair/scalp drier. I hardly felt that crawling sensation at all and did not have any clumps/scaling, not even where I would feel the crawling sensation a little. The dry scalp is nowhere near that bad as far as the visibility of flakes. When I used T-Gel this second time, I did not apply it twice. I think this is the reason why I did not have that medicated smell that much like I did the first time. My hair also seemed less dry generally with just one application, basically like it used to look before I started using T-Gel. My scalp still felt amazingly clean that week, and the itching was down even more. Absolutely nothing comes up in my fingernails now. My scalp used to go crazy every time I wore a hat, and now I can wear hats without feeling like something's crawling all over my scalp. Bottom line: I don't know why this works miracles, but it really does and does so pretty quickly. I'm not sure I'd recommend this for dry scalp issues, but I would for dandruff, buildup, eczema/dermatitis and those sorts of issues. If you've tried everything and none of it has worked, this is for you. You just need to make sure you have a good conditioner that moisturizes for use afterwards. It's also not as if I never get itches or any flakes whatsoever, but this has cut all that down dramatically.
p	Nearly 40 years ago, I used to run on the beach every lunch hour, after changing in the community locker room.  There was a dermatologist who did the same thing.  One day I made an appointment to see him for various reasons, including a dandruff problem and an itchy scalp.  He told me that he kept a bottle of this shampoo in his locker and used it himself every day in his shower after a run.  He advised me to do the same.  I responded, "You mean I should use this stuff for the rest of my life?"  He just looked at me and said, "Use it a couple of times week, if you don't want to use it every day."  Well, after several decades of daily use, I can testify that it not only works but I've had barbers ask me what kind of shampoo I use to keep my hair in such great shape.  All in all, I guess I'll use it for the rest of my life, gratefully.
p	Take this review with a grain of salt since it might not work for everyone: My occasional dandruff has gradually worsened as I've aged and about 2 years ago the dermatologist also diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis ('SD') that affects both of my ears, under and around my eyes, nose, chest, etc.  My ears have been the worst though as they itched constantly and eventually would crack and bleed so it then became an itching AND painful problem. It was pure torture.  He prescribed a couple of different steroidal and then anti-fungal creams that I had to apply 2x a day and my ears still eventually dried out, itched, cracked and bled. If I'd forgotten to apply the cream one morning or one evening, I'd be sorry by the end of the day or by the next morning.  I often wondered why there wasn't some kind of soap or cleanser that I could use in the shower for people like me with this common, stubborn skin condition. My doctor alone says he's treated thousands of patients with SD with the steroidal and anti-fungal creams, most of whom, like me, can't seem to find anything that works effectively for very long. But 99% of dermatologist recommend TGel to control dandruff, etc conditions on the scalp so... Now, I'd used TGel during the past 8 or so years off and on to control my dandruff but didn't like using it simply because the odor made my hair smell like I was trying to ward off a swarm of mosquitoes. However, when the other products that smelled better weren't effective, I always went back to TGel to solve the problem.  If I could just put up with the smell for 2 or 3 hours after using it, my itching, flaking, etc was immediately arrested - for days, even weeks at a time. (I've since found that rinsing it off well tends to remove most, but never all, of the odor). Fast forward to about 2 months ago when I saw my dermatologist to renew my seborrheic dermatitis prescription and asked him exactly what SD was.  He said that it's a fungus related to the same fungus that causes scalps to break out in dandruff.  With that in mind, I figured I'd give TGel a try on the stubborn SD in my ears, on my face, etc. and realized THAT DAY that my SD problems could be solved in the shower.  After one treatment the itching was gone.  After 2 days / 2 treatments the rash was completely gone from all parts of my body.  I'm not sure that Neutrogena would recommend it, but I was desperate to find something that effectively controlled my SD and this has been a life-changing discovery.  After two days of applying it in the shower as I would to stop a dandruff outbreak, my ears stopped itching, the skin around my nose and under my eyes stopped scaling and is softer and younger feeling than it has been since I was a teenager (I'm 46). And that's not an exaggeration. I saw my dermatologist again last month and mentioned my discovery.  He inspected my ears and the other areas on my face and chest and was duly impressed with the results.  He took notes on my experience and said that he'd bring it up to his peers in the dermatological society he's been a part of during his 30+ years at the Stanford Medical Institute.  I asked him if TGel could damage my skin or if there was any reason to be concerned about using it for this application and he said absolutely not and just look at my results for the proof.  Those pharmaceutical companies probably won't like it, but I no longer need to apply a prescription anti-fungal or steroidal creams 2x a day and this is something that I can use during my normal dandruff regimen - IN THE SHOWER! Thank you, thank you, thank you Neutrogena! I can't say enough what a difference it's made in my life.  I just hope it keeps working this well for the rest of it and that you find some value in my experience.
p	For years I suffered from embarrassing flakes and dry scalp. I used to constantly scratch my scalp and used to feel flakes all over my head. As nasty as it sounds, I had crusty patches all over my scalp for years. A week of neutrogena (used about 3-4 times) and it is completely gone. It's been about a month and I don't remember the last time my scalp felt so good. I occasionally search and try to find any sort of dry patches of some sort on my head like before and thank god I don't have any. This product is by far the best hair product I have ever bought in my life. I never wrote a review for anything, ever. But this product is so good that I just had to go out of my way to write this. Hopefully this review will convince at least one person out there to buy this product. You will not be disappointed. Absolutely guaranteed.
n	I am usually not sensitive with the smells.  I am talking about I was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong (that medicated smell lingering on your scalp).  BUTTTT...this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days, I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp.  I totally understand it's made partly with tar but I am sure even if you aren't phased by the smell yourself, others might go.."Whoa".  On the first or second day, after a trial/change of shampoo, I would feel my hair or scalp "feel" a bit better (not 100%, but FEEL).  I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed but that could just be me, individually.  If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos, give it a try, it might work for you.  The smell was obviously the factor to say NUH UH for me. By the way, I didn't experience extreme dandruff (the type that flakes all over clothes).  I just noticed for the past days, my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly and it had a tad of itchiness.  It could have been some weather changes or something but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos.
n	The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls, which I cannot stand.  I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp.  Decided to try this stuff, bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $2 off coupon.  It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can't stand the smell.  Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry, just weird.  When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results.  So if you have very short hair and don't need any body in your style, this may not be a problem for you. If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it.  Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell.  I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try.
n	I've been using it for 2 weeks and see no effects at all. My wife can't be in the same room with me because of how horrible this shampoo smells.  To me it smells like motor oil.  Maybe it's made out of recycled car oil.  I don't know.  But it doesn't do anything for flaky hair.
n	Our pedi recommended it for my 9 mo old son. He has a very dry skin and he has dandruff because of it. We tried once and it worked right away but only kept effective for 2 days. Most importantly, the smell of the product is HORRIBLE... My son cried every time (well I only used it for twice) when I applied it on his hair... I would say, this product will give you the immediate result but it won't last long.
n	One one hand, it does what it's supposed to do. It gets rid of flakes/dandruff. On the other hand, it stripped my hair and dried it out so badly, it took a week to recover, even when I used deep regular and leave in conditioners.
p	If your considering buying the Wayfarer by Ray-Ban, you already know it as a cultural staple, worn by everyone from Dylan to The Blues Brothers. But, as cool as the shades are, be careful when it comes to fit. The "New" Wayfarer is substantially smaller then the old style, as well as being a tad more modern, not dominating the face as the old kind do. The "New" style also comes in two sizes, 52mm and 55mm. I received the 52 only to find them to be a bit too small (I am an average size male), once I returned them for the 55 I was more then satisfied. So in conclusion I would recommend the new style Wayfarer to those wanting the signature look of the style, but with perhaps a bit less obtrusive frame. 55mm is average size, while 52mm would be for females or even some children.
p	I ordered 3 pairs: black, polarized, 55mm; tortoise, non-polarized, 52mm; tortoise, non-polarized, 55mm, so I was able to compare the sizes, colors and polarized feature of these glasses. Here we go. 1. Authenticity: All of the 3 pairs were sold by Amazon.com, and they all seemed genuine to me. Not even a doubt. Solid and clear. I did notice that the black pair was missing the engraved "RB" on the back of the left lenses. I don't know why. 2. Polarized: The polarized feature doesn't bother me at all in reading LCD screens, nor does it improve the view much (it cuts out a little more light, but not much difference). 3. Sizing: I am a small guy and have narrow face. The 52mm is definitely for children: a bit tight (even for me) and looks like a toy; The 55mm looks great, although i feel they can be loose sometimes (look good, but wear loose). I strongly recommend 55mm if you have to get these, unless you are buying for your kids. 4. Looks: They both look great, but I prefer the tortoise ones that are a little bit different but not too special. Another thing to note is that other people can see your eyes more easily through the ordinary lenses than the polarized lenses. 5. comparison to the OriginalWayfarer (2140): later I got a pair of 2140 (Original Wayfarer, 54mm, tortoise color) for my cousin. The Original Wayfarers are a bit more expensive, but feel they are of better quality: stronger metal hinge, thicker and heavier plastic. Size-wise, the Original Wayfarers are between the 55mm and 52mm New Wayfarers. Style-wise, the Original Wayfarers have a larger angle pointing forward. Try them out in store and buy them here! great quality and price. Just make sure they are "sold by Amazon.com" after you make the selection (there are many different sellers on Amazon). Cheers~~~ BTW Amazon says free returns on these, and they didn't even ask a word when I returned two pairs and paid for return shipping. Great customer service.
p	I really like these glasses. I was contemplating on getting polarized and or nonpolarized, a friend said, "If you're going to spend that much money on glasses and plan on keeping them, why wouldn't you spend the extra for polarized." So I bought polarized, I am glad I did! These are some really good glasses, people compliment me on them. These are just some classic glasses, I am glad I invested in a good pair of frames. Btw I bought the 52 mm, but it was a tad too small, so I upgraded to 55 mm (see picture below.) After buying quality glasses, I will start purchasing products based on quality instead of price. I take MUCH better care of these glasses, no telling how much money I wasted on all the other glasses!
p	Initially designed by Raymond Stegeman and manufactured since 1956 the Ray-Ban Wayfarers were revolutionary compared to the clichéd metal frames of past sunglasses.  The early popularity of Wayfarers throughout the 1950s and 1960s was attributed not only to look and comfort but also seen by way of celebrity acceptance of the design.  Roy Orbison, John F. Kennedy, Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol all prominently sported Wayfarers for the ever watching public eye. However the design became near extinct in the early 1980s due to the decline in sales of the 1970s.  Despite the slight reemergence in 1980, due majorly in part to the Dan Aykroyd/John Belushi hit movie The Blues Brothers, Wayfarers were on the verge of discontinuation; selling only 18,000 pairs in 1981. As fate would have it Wayfarers were completely resurrected in 1982 when Ray-Ban signed a yearly payment contract with Unique Product Placement of Burbank, California for $50,000.  The deal was simple: Wayfarers were to appear in 60 Hollywood films and television shows per year for the next five years in exchange for $250,000.  It was a contract that made Ray-Ban millions and projected the classic Wayfarer design across the world.  Movie stars, musicians, artists and celebrities  alike wore them in films, music videos, photographs and magazines making Wayfarers the sunglasses of necessity for the 1980s. The roller coaster ride hit a drop in the 1990s when 'wrap-around' frames popularized the market, striking a blow to the classic Wayfarer design and leaving them forgotten to the masses yet again.  That is until 2001 when the New Wayfarers made the scene with a smaller and less angular design, a lighter injected plastic and a multitude of new colors.  The redesign helped the 2000s to be a nostalgic success, bolstering the best sales in over a decade and reuniting the public with the classic, comfortable design that made them popular to begin with. So here we are in 2013 and the 'New Wayfarers' are already over a decade old and still selling.  Widely regarded as the 20th century's most enduring fashion icons the Wayfarer design is comfortable, light and always classic.  For those of you browsing the Amazon product page looking for your perfect pair of New Wayfarers there are a few things you might want to know.  First thing: the size. You may have noticed the option of purchasing either 52mm or 55mm sized Wayfarers on the product page.  This combined with a plethora of reviews regarding the sizes that fit best seem to be a matter of major confusion.  Many of the reviews for this product, including the most popular, are simply wrong and misleading.  There is no difference in frame size between the 52mm and the 55mm design and the number is a reference to the lens size.  What does this mean?  Well, if you purchase the 55mm your lenses will be slightly rounder: that's it.  The reviewers complaining about the 52mm being too tight as opposed to the 55mm are misinformed.  I've included measurements below and the sizes for both products are as follows: Ray-Ban New Wayfarers 52mm: Total size:18-145mm Lens: 53mm Bridge: 18mm Temples: 145mm Ray-Ban New Wayfarers 55mm: Total size:18-145mm Lens: 55mm Bridge: 18mm Temples: 145mm As you can see there is no difference despite a slightly larger lens opening on the 55mm.  I don't understand how so many reviewers could get this wrong unless they're cross-hypnotizing one another into believing the size difference...and yes.  I own both sizes. You also may have noticed the lens option of  G-15 XLT when selecting your sunglasses.  What is it?  G-15 XLT is a reference to Ray-Ban's glass lenses as opposed to their plastic designs.  G-15 is a special technology that Ray-Ban utilizes to make the glass lenses light without sacrificing optical quality.  So what does the XLT stand for? Exta Light. Some of you may not be familiar with polarized lenses, which is a buying option when selecting your New Wayfarers.  Erinn Morgan of All About Vision writes 'light reflected from surfaces such as a flat road or smooth water generally is horizontally polarized. This means that, instead of light being scattered in all directions in more usual ways, reflected light generally travels in a more horizontally oriented direction. This creates an annoying and sometimes dangerous intensity of light that we experience as glare. Polarized sunglasses cut glare and haze so your eyes are more comfortable and you can see better.  Polarized lenses contain a special filter that blocks this type of intense reflected light, reducing glare. Though polarized sunglasses improve comfort and visibility, you will encounter some instances when these lenses may not be advisable. One example is downhill skiing, where you don't want to block light reflecting off icy patches because this alerts skiers to hazards they are approaching. In addition, polarized lenses may reduce the visibility of images produced by liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or light-emitting diode displays (LEDs) found on the dashboards of some cars or in other places such as the digital screens on automatic teller machines and self-service gas pumps. With polarized lenses, you also may be unable to see your cell phone or GPS device. Boaters and pilots also have reported similar problems when viewing LCD displays on instrument panels, which can be a crucial issue when it comes to making split-second decisions based strictly on information displayed on a panel.' I hope this review clears up any confusion with the design and aids you in making the correct purchase.
p	Got what I paid for. Authentic Ray Ban 2132 55mm New Wayfarer Matte Black with Blue Polarized Gradient Lenses. I don't know why I made it all caps, but this product was the real deal. I got worried after reading some of these reviews but the glasses I received are 100% authentic. I compared them to my old pair of New Wayfarers 2132 purchased from Ray Ban themselves and they match up perfectly. The logo, the RB on the left lens, the metal rod in the arm, and the case were all identical. Would definitely buy from here again if I decide to get myself a third pair.
n	Mine arrived with a brown case, not black. They appear to not be actual rayban glasses, as I have purchased 3 pair of the same with no issues.  There were fingerprints on the lenses and oil on inner the temples. They weren't wrapped in plastic either. Be highly suspect when purchasing.
n	Ray-Ban RB2132 New Wayfarer Polarized Sunglasses,Black/Green Polarized,52 mm I just received a pair of New Wayfarers (polarized, 52mm, black w/green lenses, sold by Amazon) and at first they seemed to be legitimate--the box seemed to be real, as well as the case. However, upon taking out the sunglasses, they did not seem to be high-quality. The hinges squeak quite audibly when opening the glasses, and the "RB" etching seems to be messily scratched on rather than laser-etched. I've just ordered a pair of New Wayfarers off of the official Ray Ban website, and will update the review with comparison pictures before I return the Amazon pair. EDIT: Added photos for comparison. I received real new wayfarers (non-polarized, however) from the Ray Ban Website the other day. They are the glasses with the gold sticker and brown case, and are on the right hand side in all of my photos. The discrepancies between the stickers and the case are not, however, the cause of concern.
n	I purchased the Ray-Ban RB2132 52mm sunglasses from Amazon last week. As I read some reviews that some individuals were receiving a fake pair of Ray-Bans, I decided to purchase the sunglasses from "Amazon.com" as the seller. Thinking that I would be safe from receiving counterfeit sunglasses from Amazon's warehouse, I felt confident in my purchase. However, I was very wrong. When I received the sunglasses and opened the packaging, I knew immediately that these sunglasses were fake. Namely due to the following reasons: 1) No Ray-Ban logo on the right and left temples of the sunglasses. 2) On the inside temple it said, "Made in China". 3) The lenses were cheap plastic lenses, and I purchased the "polarized lenses". 4) The sunglasses for larger than 55mm, not the 52mm that I ordered. Be wary when ordering these sunglasses from Amazon.com!
n	I ordered these sunglasses "shipped and sold by Amazon" and was amazed to find that they are fake. I took them to a Sunglass Hut (who's parent company owns the Ray-Ban brand) and it turns out they make look like the real thing, but the lenses are too small. It is unbelievable that Amazon would sell fake Ray-Bans. They need to sort this out with their suppliers.
n	This is what I purchased: Ray-Ban RB2132 New Wayfarer Polarized Sunglasses,Black/Green Polarized,52 mm Sold by: Amazon.com LLC ******************************************************************************************** Packaging: Sunglasses came in black Ray-Ban leather case, which is inside a white box, which is in another Amazon Prime box. Where is the original box that ALL Ray-Ban sunglasses come in? I want to know all the details about this $110 sunglasses that I bought. I want EVERYTHING that comes with it originally. Sunglasses: * Arrived with no plastic sleeves on the arms (like it's supposed to). * Fingerprints AND sticky residue all over the lens and frame. It was really gross. There was a huge blob of sticky residue behind the "Ray-Ban" logo. Sketchy much? * No stickers on the sunglasses' lens like the sticker to indicate it is polarized. * RB sketch on the lens were not smooth and was on the front of lens. It seems like there was a difficulty in sketching the "R" because top of it was even. (I compared this to a authentic RB2132 non-polarized sunglasses. The authentic sunglasses had smooth RB sketch on the inside of the lens.) * Left arm inside prints were unaligned--the model should be printed closer to the hinge. * Right arm print not clear. * The polarized lens are definitely polarized, but it has some type of film on the inside of the lens where it would reflect green/purple light. I don't remember seeing this in the stores, but I have never owned polarized lens before so I don't know if this should be the case or not. * The arms (when folded) were not cut smoothly. Case: The sunglasses case were leather and it seemed authentic enough; however, the stitching wasn't perfect. There was a loose end. Conclusion: FAKE! This seems like a very GOOD fake. If I am wrong, and it is not a fake, then at least Amazon should sell it with its original retail box. I have owned two Ray-Ban sunglasses before and I know how they should be packaged. This was all wrong. The glasses need to arrive in clean and new condition too. Those fingerprints and sticky residue were really gross. I didn't even want to touch the sunglasses. I had to wipe it off with some Lysol wipes before even trying it on.
p	If you have been wearing this series of shoes through every generation as I have, you know Asics messed up the line in a huge way when the 21xx series was replaced with the GT2000 series. Too firm. Many runners reported injuries. Why change what was probably the bestselling running shoe in the industry (a competitor's product manager revealed that to me years ago). Based on a few encouraging reviews I bought the 3rd generation of this GT2000 shoe and I'm pleased to share- the cushioning is at least as good as and maybe better than the 2170's. THEY'RE BACK! Many order 1/2 size larger and I prefer the 2E width, but sizing hasn't changed from past models. If you gave up on this line of shoes, come back. You'll be glad you did.
p	I know reviews are mixed, but I love the shoe.  Fits perfectly.  Feels cushiony.  Light enough.  Provides plenty of stability and minimizes roll. I am a 200 pound male runner that suffers from Sinus Tarsi syndrome due to my feet rolling, but I was able to go right out in this shoe WITHOUT my orthotics and have had ZERO issues after racking up some serious mileage.  Also not a hint of return of previous plantar fasciitis issues.  Comfort and injury free ... can't beat it, well worth paying a few extra bucks for. I did order the wider size, and am very glad I did; it does feel like it might be ever-so-slightly slimmer than other shoes I have had. By the way, I have not been truly thrilled with any shoe since the old 2170 from a few years back, but in my mind this shoe is every bit as good. UPDATE 8/2/15: As of 8/2/15 - just ordered my THIRD pair so I can swap out during the week, plus my original ones are starting to get some wear (for good reason). I have put down anywhere from 50 to 70 miles per week with ZERO issues, except my highest mileage pair has a little tear in the fabric on top of the toe-box near my small right toe joint (but purely cosmetic, even that pair still feels great). This is something of a miracle to me after suffering through injuries the last few years; this is more mileage than I did at my "peak" 20 years ago.  The shoes aren't cheap but are so well worth it; still incredibly highly recommended!
p	Love the new m GT model. I have wide feet and normally by this model for the stability. This shoe fits good and feels great after break-in. I love the look also. ASICS is awesome. I bought another brand recently and should probably send them back because in comparison to ASICS they lose.
p	Everything was as expected, as it should be. After having wore these for a few wks. I must say that these are the best and most comfortable shoes I've ever had. I'm not even a runner, but am a walker. I've tried various walking shoes over the yrs., but thought I'd try running shoes. It was a great decision to try these. They fit perfectly, have great arch support, and are just plain fun to wear.
p	This shoe is a nice looking shoe that is very well built, but what I really need is a shoe size 12.5 / 2E shoe.  I always have to buy a size 13 to get the width I need in a medium width shoe.  If you look through Asics selection of 2E/4E width shoes it is very limited to certain styles and colors.  I understand that marketing personnel for the company make the call on what they believe sells best, but I believe if they offered a better selection of wider width shoes they would see higher sales in total rather than seeing that market share go to other brands which do offer people better width selections/colors.
n	GT-2XXX Series Glue Fails on Sole Pieces and even from Boot to Sole. Asics Support comment "2 yr from manufacture warrantee." Not from date of purchase? They likely spent 6 months in a Chinese Shipping container. Can't gamble on them again. You shouldn't either.
n	I normally wear a regular width size 11 in asics.  I had to go up to 11 1/2 2E for these shoes to work for me,  I do not like them as much as the old GT 2170's they replaced. To me they seem less supportive than the  GT 2170.  Asics has cost me a lot of money sending back shoes d/t changing the width and support of their shoes.
n	The sizing seems to have changed with the GT-2000 3; this shoe is just under a half-size larger than a GT-2000 2 of the same claimed size (12.5 4E). Sadly, I didn't notice the size differential when I first tried them on; however, after only two days, the shoes left gouges in my heels. I have bought GT-2000 series shoes for more than 10 years (and usually three or more pairs per year, as I'm a big-time forefoot striker), and I've never experienced this problem before. I'm seriously disappointed that Asics felt the need to change the relationship between the size of the shoe and the size indicated on the label.
n	The GT-2000 3 is less comfortable and less supportive than my previous pair of Asics. My previous Asics owned was the GT- 2140. They were durable, comfortable, and supportive. I will be shopping for another pair to excersise in.
n	The shoe fits well, and provides good arch support. Like the Asics shoes of previous generation. However, the sole is not exactly the same as before. Feels like something is missing. The shock absorption was much better in my earlier Asics, although that wasn't a specialty running shoe. When I run in these shoes, I can feel a lot more shock in my soles as well as heels. I guess, I will be switching to Salomon or Nike for my next running shoes. For a casual use, this one is alright.
p	These socks have great ventilation through the top, and they have some reinforcement on the toes/ball/heel. I've had no problems with heat or sweat since wearing these. There is a seam running along the top across the toes that can be a bit annoying depending on how it is positioned, though I've found that if I shift them around a bit I can find a comfortable position. According to the Under Armour website the men's sizing (based on U.S. shoe size) goes as follows: MD - 4 to 8.5 LG - 9 to 12.5 XL - 13 to 16 Overall I would recommend these socks as they are a good deal for the value.
p	Good socks that fit well. I particularly like the white ones with the UA logo on the heel. I will also add that they are the right 'short' length to wear with joggers. I wear a size 10.5 shoe and the large size in the socks fit perfectly. Well recommended. Cheers, JFE
p	Purchased April 27th 2014. As you can see from the picture they have stretched significantly. However, it took a year & half for them to reach that point. The new pair was purchased August 12, 2015. I wanted to mention that none had holes in them...just stretched & faded. They held up real good.
p	My shoe size is 9.5-10. The socks in the "Large" category for that shoe size were too big and loose fitting. So I ordered a Medium size which was a perfect fit for me! The socks are very comfortable a size smaller and aren't too tight. They fit perfectly. These are great socks especially for runners, hikers or long distance walkers. The fabric is thin at the top of the lower toe area which allows sweat to escape the sock and helps to keep your feet dry. These socks are designed to prevent slipping inside the shoes as well. I don't remember experiencing any slipping, so I guess they're working as far as that goes. One thing I'm highly disappointed in however is the durability of the fabric in a part of the sock that doesn't get worn or stepped on or scraped against. There's an area that's VERY prone to tear where the point of the gray fabric meets the black fabric at the heal on both sides of the sock. I don't know why or how, but so far, 3 pairs out of 12 pairs of socks have been damaged to the point that I can't wear them anymore. This might be a design flaw. Pros: As long as you get a size down from your shoe size, they'll fit snug and will be very comfortable. They also look good in skater shoes and low ankle Vans and Convers shoes as well. They help sweat to escape by the see-through fabric on top of the toe area and they prevent slipping inside shoes to allow for better performance when running or other sports that require balance and stamina. Cons: The sizing isn't very good. Medium is for shoe size 4-8.5, but my shoe size is 9.5-10 and the medium socks fit perfectly. The large socks don't fit me and are too long and too loose for me. There may be a sewing or design defect on the sides of the socks where the point of the gray fabric meets the black fabric as the fabric is prone to large holes in that one area. Overall: I'll continue buying more of these socks in a smaller size despite the possible sewing or design defect as the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
p	These are very comfortable socks and I ended up purchasing 60 pairs.  Yes, you heard me correctly, 60 pairs.  Why?  My son now wears the same size shoe as I do and my wife is constantly 'borrowing' my socks.  Also, was tired of sorting socks and having the laundry gremlin stealing the left sock (joke here).  So, I figured I would just solve multiple problems with one purchase. The socks are very comfortable.  I have several pairs of REI light hiking socks that sell for almost $12 a pair, and these are far cheaper.  I have not gone on a long hike, but just long walks, and the socks are very comfortable.  No problem with blisters, chafing, or wrinkling in the shoe.  I love these socks and they are such a bargain compared to the REI socks. This is the sizing chart from the Under Armour website.  I wear a 9 1/2 wide and the Large fit fine. MD  LG  XL MEN'S  4 - 8 1/2  9 - 12 1/2  13 - 16 WOMEN'S  7 - 10 1/2  11 - 13 A negative reviewer mentioned seams.  I'm not sure what the issues is, but the top seam is pretty flush.  There might be an issue for some on the inside of the sock where the stitching is located with extra weaving.  I can't tell nor do I notice it.  It feels pretty soft and unlike other socks with the seam on the interior, I cannot feel it.  They also sit at the top of the toe, rather than under.  As noted before, I walk a fairly good distance with my dog every morning and it hasn't caused any problems. Very happy with the price, the quality, and the purchase.  Better than expected and very comfortable.
n	These socks lasted me less than 3 months. I'm not hard on socks...cheap type socks can last me years. So, when I bought these from UA(I love UA gear--their hoodies are a great purchase) I thought I might be getting the same great quality of clothing. Not so. In the past few weeks I have had to throw away 5 pairs of socks due to big holes developing at the ball of my foot. The material, I admit is comfortable, but it's also very thin...and apparently, cheap. I guess it's back to buying cheap socks... ☺
n	I've always loved UAs products, but these socks were just horrible.  Every single sock developed a hole in the big toe within two weeks of purchasing them.  I've had to throw them all out.  This is absolutely ridiculous, as I've had other socks that have lasted years.  Not sure what the problem is here.  Very disappointed.
n	I bought these socks and within 2 wears, they already had holes in them. I am so upset with this purchase. What a waste of money. This picture was taken after 1 day of wearing them.
n	Be it either a bait and switch tactic or just unintentional deterioration of product quality due to changed production facilities and standards, these socks do not live up to their reputation as bestowed upon them from previous reviews.  I wash them after 1 days use in the gentle and cold wash/dry cycles and only after 2 uses, they have already developed holes near the toes.  I will definitely not be buying these socks again.
n	I wore a pair of these socks one time for a long run and  both socks had holes in them following the run. Very disappointed
p	My five year old granddaughter loved it.  It is very special to her and to me.  Perfect size for a little one.
p	The sterling silver children's diamond cross pendant with a 15" chain was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for a little girl's First Communion.  It arrived within the 2 days as promised.  I would recommend this to others as a gift for a young child.
p	These sterling silver diamond cross pendants for children are absolutely lovely.  I purchased two to give to my two grand daughters at Easter.  I found them to be delicate and everything that I wanted in a gift cross necklace.  I am very satisfied with my purchases and recommend them.
p	This was the most amazing gift I could have ever given my 7 year old just as she was preparing to enter the church for her First Holy Communion. The chain is simple and delicate and I believe it's perfect length for a little girl. The cross size was (my opinion) just a perfect weight and size for the size of my daughter, and the shape of the cross, along with the little diamond (chip?) is very, very tastefully done. Not just the straight-lined variety of crosses that are abundantly available. You will not be disappointed at all and again - everything about this product is proportionate to my daughter's build. The fact that it is .925 silver, and has a diamond chip in it for under $40 dollars? I am ordering a second one for my other daughter who is only 5 to give to her on her First Holy Communion as well. Buy with confidence! It comes in a nice box. Note- I am the most meticulous, picky individual on the face of this Earth and I am 100% serious that this item will not disappoint you.
p	Purchased this for my 3 year old as a baptism present. The chain is the perfect length and the cross is just the right size for a toddler.
n	I returned this item because it was so tiny that it was almost dwarfed by the bail.  Even though it was sterling with a diamond chip, I didn't think it was worth the price.  I actually bought a much nicer cross at the local department store for about $10 less.
n	I was extremely disappointed when I received the product. The pendant itself is quite beautiful but the chain is truly an insult. The link is tiny and extremely fragile. I was actually embarrassed to give it as a gift because the chain made it appear so cheap. It would have been better to sell the pendant by itself rather than misleading the public into thinking that they were getting a worthwhile package of both a chain and a pendant.
n	The image on Amazon makes the cross appear much larger than it really is.  I bought this for a 4 year old and it's much more suited for a toddler.  The cross is only 1/2 inch long b 3/8 inch wide.  I'm sure she'll like it but I don't feel it's a good value for the price.  After a year it will probably be too small for her to wear and become only a shiny reminder of her Bautizo. At the current price, I would not recommend it to others.
n	I bought this for my 2 year old niece's baptism.  The cross and chain are pretty and well-made, but the "diamond chip" is barely visible with the naked eye.  I'm still going to give it to her, because it is pretty, but don't expect the diamond chip to enhance the impact of this necklace.
n	I bought this necklace for my 4 year old who loves jewelry and she did love it..... for a day until she broke it.  The chain is very thin and broke with very little use by my daughter, very disappointed especially for the price.
p	Hard to find a watch for a 6 year old that fits well around their tiny wrists.  This watch fits perfectly and he loves it - only negative item is that the light already went out, within a few months of purchase.
p	My 5 year old wanted a watch, and I ended up picking this one. It's a nice watch, very readable and easy to program. The band is fabric, which is more comfortable for my kiddo than a rubber or plastic band, so he actually wears it. For the money, it's a great watch for a young kid.
p	This watch is easy enough for a child to use, and still has lots of features.  Would recommend. Happy with the purchase!
p	Terrific product.  Easy fit and easy for my 7 year old to use.
p	It is simple to use - he figured it out on his own. Looks great and functional!  Great features that are perfect for active boys.
n	I think when they mean kids, they mean pre-schoolers.  Very cool looking and seems to work fine, but did not fit my normal sized 10 year old nephew.
n	My daughter loves the look and feel of the watch, but a few of the buttons fell off the second day we had it
n	still works after first two weeks but the mode button fell off when being used the first time to set the time.  I reattached it and am hoping it stays put.
n	This thing is not waterproof. I am not talking about diving here. You can't even swim with it. Terrible purchase.
n	Good attempt at a child's digital watch with timer, chronograph, and alarms.  But overall the watch feels lightweight and cheap.  I'm disappointed in the quality of the buttons on the watch.  All the functions are there and operable, but I'm not sure my 8 and 9 year old granddaughters will have the patience to set them.  The band seems sturdy at first wearing.  Time will tell! I would much rather have paid more to get a watch that's more like the quality of the women's ironman that I've been buying and wearing daily for 20 years.  I bought these watches for the Ironman functions, not a low price.
p	I compared 4 wallets in about 3 hours: 1. Timberland Commuter Brown Bifold Leather Wallet 2. Alpine Swiss Men's Genuine Leather Wallet Slim Flip-out Bifold Black 3. Dockers Mens Extra Capacity Slimfold Leather Wallet, Black, One Size 4. HUSKK Leather Wallet for Men - Credit Card Sleeve Holder This leather wallet is the the winner ! The longer version…background story I finally decided to replace the wallet my grandpa gave me about 20 years ago. I've replaced parts of it a few times now, and the leather is now so streatched, that cards keep falling out. My next wallet has a lot to live up to, so i bought four of them to compare. In my experiments, I put a full set of personal cards - and then a bunch of business cards and store cards too. I have a lot of cards. 1. TIMBERLAND: 2/5 stars - poor plastic attachment excellent leather, suede-like, single, but neat stitching spaces - fairly tight with 4 stacked pockets, but good 2 plastic pockets on flap, stitching already coming apart on plastic 8 inside pockets 2 spade spaces behind inside pockets 12 spaces + 1 bill space 2. Tommy Hilfiger 4/5 stars - flawed design excellent leather + fabric, smooth glossy, stupid logo and red, white, and blue ribbon which will fray and break spaces - very tight, credit cards cannot fit in some spaces, not enough give in the folds to close, cannot remove cards with one hand when full 1 strong, clear plastic space 5 pockets on the flap 2 inside pockets on the flap 4 normal pockets 2 spaces under normal pockets 14 spaces + 1 bill space + comes with a plastic photo/card holder insert if you want it 3. DOCKERS BIFOLD 3/5 stars - cheap feeling, but excellent size cheap plasticy leather feel, cheap feeling plasticy fabric, smooth, nice embossed logo, double stiching on front spaces - about perfect, can remove cards with one hand 3 left pockets 1 space under left pockets 3 flap pockets (left side) 1 space under flap pockets (left side) 1 strong plastic pocket on flap (right side) 3 right pockets 1 space under right pockets 12 spaces + 1 bill space 4. HUSKK Leather Wallet for Men 5/5 stars excellent construction, like the HUSKK's bifold design, but overall much smaller profile, fits well in your hand spaces are tight, but not too tight like the tommy pockets; excellent construction, minimalist design, exceptional leather 2 left pockets 1 money strap 1 of the pockets also has a clear ID window fits a lot of cards and cash while staying super slim comes with RFID blocking technology, which is awesome. Think it should be compulsory for all the wallets these days to prevent electronic theft and pick pocketing Overall - the Tommy Hilfiger is beautifully constructed, but flawed in the design - it would be very hard to actually use these wallets b/c some of the pockets don't fit normal credit cards. plus a bit bulky for me. - the timberland wallet has nice leather, but the plastic is cheap and the overall construction is poor, with stitching broken out of the box - the dockers wallet is slightly lighter and a millimeter shorter than the HUSKK's bifold, but the dockers construction is shabby at best - huskk’s wallet is an excellent and well sized. there is a difference b/w the two: there is a strap in one version for easy access to the cards, however I found that I can manage getting the card I need quite easily even without a strap; then there is RFID blocking coating tech; as well as metal strap vs leather cash strap and there is a transparent ID window on one of the versions. the design is very cool, subtle, not in your face. Even though i’m a big fan of the huskk ones, I think one should try and ordering 2 of these together for a final verdict. You have nothing to loose, amazon has 30 day return policy. Conclusion The HUSKK's wallets are great! I'm going to try the bifold because it is bigger, holds more cards, and cards are easy to take in and out of it with one hand - but I may come back to the ultra slim version if I ditch some cards. Packaging note: The packaging on all of these was off, the HUSKK wallet was the only one in a nice, premium yet subtle hard box with a nice inner pouch, see the packaging among their product images.
p	I don't write reviews often (actually this is my first review), but I felt like this deserved one.  I've always hated wallets because I have to carry a lot of things in my pockets as it is, and the wallets I had before this one were big, fat, and left my pockets bulging so much that a pick-pocketer would salivate at the sight of them.  I used a Slim Clip for a few years (like on the commercials), but I got sick of it rubbing off all the writing on my credit cards, so I finally decided to look for a good quality wallet that won't make my pants bulge. This fit the bill perfectly.  Let me get one thing out of the way right now: this isn't a big wallet.  If you're looking for a wallet with lots of compartments for cards, ID's, coins, and anything else, look elsewhere.  This has only 3 slots for credit cards, one slot for your ID, and I put one more card in the removable sleeves for pictures, which works fine for me.  The advantage of the lack of compartments is that it's super thin.  It's obviously not quite as thin as my Slim Clip was, but surprisingly it's not too far off. Quality-wise, this thing is made great!  It has that great leather feel with the Tommy Hilfiger logo sewn in on the front.  I feel like this thing could last me years if I needed it to (and I probably will).  The box it came in was also a foreshadowing of the quality of the wallet; it was cardboard with leather sewn in on the front.  I almost didn't want to throw it away. To conclude, if you want a wallet that can hold a huge number of cards and coins, keep looking.  But if you want a thin wallet that'll hold cash and a few credit cards, and look great doing it, then buy this wallet.  You won't be disappointed. UPDATE: Two years later, and this wallet is still going strong!  I fully expect this thing to last me another ten, twenty years if I want it to (and I likely will).  They just don't make long-lasting products like this anymore.  I would recommend this thing to anyone.  I'll never need another wallet.
p	It's really a good wallet for students or office worker. Tommy Hilfiger is quite popular with young men all over the world but i don't think its wallet products are very suitable for Chinese. The RMB paper money is much wider than USD and when couples of RMB are put in the wallet, a little part of them will stick out. That's why i don't rate it 5 stars but 4.
p	This is a small type of wallet, just a few compartments for IDs and credit cards and one compartment for cash. Cool, simple and very stylish. I'm very happy with it, and you will be if you are looking to buy a wallet you want to keep in a back pocket of your jeans. It want make a bulge on your behind as it doesn't have that coin compartment, made of leather, in a nice box. This would be an excellent gift for any guy!
p	Purchased this wallet to replace an ancient wallet I carried for years. This wallet comes with a removable sleeve which you can insert you ID in. Several slots for credit cards and a deep cash slot. So your cash doesn't show as much when looking in your wallet. Good leather feel with the Tommy Hilfiger sewn in. Not big and bulky, very flat and not to complicated. Just a very good quality leather wallet!
n	Well. I bought a lot of items from Amazon. This one is the worse. Please look at my picture. It has a serious quality problem. I bought it a week ago. The leather peels off. It seems the leather and the color are not dry enough. Or the leather is false.
n	This is disappointing. When I open the pakage, i see a fancy box with a old-look wallet in it. It has a lot of dirt on it and even some scratches. Gonna return it.
n	Need much more Finish treatment effort in Stitch and Bonding areas with respect to brand name value, looks fake [imitation].
n	It was a birthday gift for my friend. The box was high quality but when I opened it I was very dissapointed. The leather quality is very poor and the wallet doesn't looks so good in reality as on this pictures.  It's not a good gift for a friend and even it's a shame to give this wallet to somebody as a gift. I didn't expected such a bad quality and not only the quality , but the look is much worse than on the pictures. It's very funny, but the leather quality of the box was even much better than the wallet leather quality.
n	The picture provided on the product page is not comparable to the product that I received in the mail in terms of quality. The box that the wallet came in looks old and bent. The wallet itself is dusty and not in the greatest of conditions. Although this probably isn't a used wallet, it does, however, look like a wallet that has been sitting in the bottom of a clearance pile for years on end-- therefore giving it an old, dirty look. It comes complete with tattered edges, blemishes on the front and back. In addition, the plastic on the inside of the wallet for your ID is filled with dust particles that immediately alarms the customer (see picture provided). I would stay away from this purchase until the quality matter is fixed.
p	I really wanted to love this device. However, as I write this, there are hundreds of apps/games in the Amazon App store that are showing as not compatible with the "Fire TV", but are compatible  with the "Fire TV (Previous Generation)".  I have called Amazon's Fire TV Support about this, and when I do the agents put me on hold, and then come back and tell me that Amazon is aware of this issue.  I would love for Amazon to comment on this review and tell us that they are working on a fix for this.  Here are some details of the data that I have gathered from the Amazon App store. 1) Doing a search for Apps & Games/Fire TV  Apps (All Models), it currently comes back with: Fire TV (3,823) Fire TV (Previous Generation) (4,059) 2) Doing a search for  Apps & Games/Fire TV  Apps (All Models):Games, it currently comes back with: Fire TV (1,030) Fire TV (Previous Generation): (1,161) A sampling of some games that I found  in the App Store to be  compatible with "Fire TV (Previous Generation)", but not with "Fire TV" are: Grand Theft Auto (various versions),  Asphalt 8, Modern Combat 4. Since the new Fire TV has a more powerful processor than the "Previous Generation", this doesn't make sense to me. I preordered this device to supplement my Fire TV Stick to be able to play all those additional games (that the App Store had said, before this new version, had worked with the Fire TV).  Does Amazon have to recertify each of the apps for the new version of the Fire TV, and that hasn't happened yet? *** Update 10/11/2015: 1) The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games are now showing in the App Store as compatible with the new Fire TV. 2) When I check the four counts again for Apps and for Games, there is a very small variation from before (less than 20 for each of the counts), and with "Fire TV (Previous Generation)" still far exceeding  "Fire TV". *** Update 10/29/2015: More and more games are showing up under "Fire TV". I see that  "Asphalt 8:Airborne" has become compatible since the last time I had checked. That's good.  Perhaps it's the case that authors are needing to provide updates for their apps under the latest Fire TV platform.  I am raising my rating.
p	As an owner of rokus, firetv stick, and gen1 firetv box, i'm pleased thus far with this upgrade. Everything has been beefed up, but a couple of downsides also still exist/have been added. Plus one big bonus (for me at least): It can play files off a usb stick! If you're looking for a quick summary: This box is IMO the new standard in media boxes, it has the most power, a ton of features, and if you're a prime member you have access to a ton of content. The new game controller is a nice refinement over the gen1 controller and amazon seems intent on really expanding their game library. They should have also included the standard remote, since gaming isn't its sole purpose! Now let's break down the key points: -New game controller is more ergonomic than the gen1 and adds a headphone port(seriously a great thing to have) -Doesn't come with the standard remote, rather annoying to use the game controller for media... -Adds 4k ability, but you need 4k content(netflix charges $4 extra for this), and newer TV with latest HDMI & HDCP spec -Can play (some) files strait off a usb drive, i tried a 1080 mp4 file, played perfectly. MKV played but no sound (will investigate further) -Adds more power, it operates very snappy, even the terrible HBO Go app works well -No more optical output was a big bummer for me, had to purchase an hdmi to optical box (may not pertain to everyone) -Microsd card port is a great addition and has me hopeful that they will add beefier games for it -Adds alexa for voice operations, but i already own an echo :) Gaming I'm not seeing a big difference over the gen1 box, but i'm rooting for them to really step up their game with... games. The hardware is beefier, the the microsd port takes care of storage needs, and the new game controller is right up there with the best of xbox and playstation. Let's see some action! I also really really like that they put a headphone port on the game controller, just really convenient. Plays video files! This was a big curiosity for me, because i have a lot of videos on drives (being a videographer does that to you), and being able to just take a usb stick with a file and plug it in is great. I downloaded ES file explorer, navigated to the file, and the darn thing played with no fuss! Then i loaded up an MKV and another mp4 4k file. The MKV played the video, but with no audio. I need to investigate more, since i'm using the hdmi to optical adapter. the 4k mp4 would not play at all. More testing shall be done! 4K Sweet! Oh wait.. i don't have a 4k tv... no matter, it still looks fantastic on my 1080 projector. If you have a 4k tv though, it's certainly a great perk. Be warned though that just because you have this 4k box and a 4k tv it doesn't mean everything is automatically 4k. Some amazon prime content is 4K, and some netflix content as well, but netflix will want you to fork over another $4/month to unlock the higher resolution. Also, other reviewers have found out that 4k will not work unless your tv has hdmi 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 Optical port GONE While i like the micro sd card port, i really wish they kept the optical port. For many folks this will not matter, but for my particular setup it necessitated buying a box that pulls optical out of hdmi. I use a projector with a sound bar. Alexa voice control I've been using the amazon echo for months, and we love it. It's interesting that they added it to the firetv, but i don't see yet if there's any real reason for us to talk to the tv vs the echo. Hopefully they add more firetv specific controls for it. Stability I'm seeing a lot of reviews reporting bugs, but thus far i have not experienced any. Could be a quality control issue, could be internet connectivity. I have been using a direct Ethernet plugin even though it has wifi. So that could be a reason for other's troubles. Amazon does release updates quite regularly, so i would be optimistic about them sorting out any bugs floating around. Frequently asked questions: -How do i open the remote's battery door? A: Hold the remote so your thumb is over the bottom rear end (there's a little symbol), press in and down -Does it come with netflix? A: netflix is a free app, but you still need to pay the monthly subscription -Are there free channels? A: Yes, there are several free apps which contain lots of free movies and TV, just don't expect new releases -My TV already has apps like netflix, is this box worth the upgrade? A: I would say yes, it contains a lot more functionality than most TVs, and can connect other devices like game controllers -Does it make everything 4K? A: No, unless something is listed specifically as UHD/4k/SuperHD, you're just getting plain old 720/1080 Recommendation If you already have a gen1 box, i don't think this is worth the upgrade unless these extra features truly apply to you. It feels much the same as the gen1 box in my day to day uses, but i will find use for the new features as well. If you're looking for your first streamer, most folks do perfectly fine with just the fire tv stick, it does most of what these boxes do at a fraction of the cost. weigh the options and choose what's right for your needs!
p	I've been using a roku 3 and a chromecast for more than a year now. The reasons why I wanted to switch over to the Amazon Fire TV is because: 1) it has HBO Now (roku doesn't yet; Chromecast does but requires the use of smartphone as remote control which I hate). 2) has a voice remote. Plenty of times I'd rahter just say what I'm looking for rather than clicking one letter at a time. 3) I have Amazon Prime. 4) I like that it prefetches video content before I even click play, so it loads faster. 5) Freetime parental controls for my 5 year old and 3 year old. 6) 1080p (roku 3 version that I have goes only to 720p). Review: BEWARE - the gaming edition does NOT come with a voice remote - the game controller is used as the remote. I wasn't aware of that when I quickly hit the click-to-buy button. Amazon did describe it right by saying exactly what the gaming edition came with, but they also did point the fact out that the game controller is used as the main remote control, too. Unfortunately, I'll be returning the gaming edition for a regular edition because of this. It just doesn't make sense to have my wife and two kids use a game controller to control the Fire TV. It's sorta ridiculous. Sadly, Amazon didn't even label the buttons as far as where the rewind, fast forward, play, and pause buttons are. Moving forward, set up was pretty easy. It downloaded and installed a couple software updates that took less than 10 minutes to complete. Wifi connected as it should. The Fire was pre-registered by Amazon so i didnt have to sign in with my Amazon password, which was nice. I like the user interface as it was laid out in a simple, easy to understand fashion. There's even a Prime tab to makenit easier for Prime members. Videos all popped up and played right away without any lag or pixelation. I played the Sword something game that came free with this device. It reminds me of nintendo graphics and sound but it sorta fun. I also have a wii and Xbox 360 which I never play so you can say I am just not much of a gamer anymore. The controller was comfy amd reminded me of my xbox controller. As someone else pointed out, if you haven't used the controller for x minutes, then it goes to standby mode which requires you push a button to wake it up then again to do what you want. I understand the reasoning but I also don't like it not responding the first time. I set up Freetime but I can't find a way to sign out of the regular profile so that when the kids turn on the tv, it'll be in their profile instead of mine, otherwise it's pointless if Amazon (or parents) expect their kids to click into their restricted profile when they are already in an unrestricted profile. I like the whole photo cloud idea. I haven't used it yet, but supposedly an app can be installed on my phone. Then I upload my favorite photos. Fire TV will then sync it to the TV. Pretty cool idea. Oh, I noticed a lot of people complained about the battery door to the regular remote being too difficult to open. That's nit the case with the game controller. Very easy to open. There was a little bit of lag between controller and Fire TV for about 10 minutes after starting up. But afterwards, it seemed to catch up and was very responsive. The resolution that I was receiving was great, too. Definitely a bit better than the 720p I was receiving via Roku 3. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this device. It's clean, responsive, provides good resolution for my needs (1080p), has voice recognition /input, and makes it easy to get to my Amazon Prime stuff. Oh, I tried out Alexa for the 1st time. Not bad, she gave me the weather forecast. I'll see what else she can do later. I'll report back when I have more experience with this Fire.
p	First, a poem about my newfound gaming machine Amazon of Gaming TV Fire Quad core, dedicated GPU, not a liar Sleek black remote whose curves fit in hand More games and features than I can understand Throw in a micro SD, one card to rule them all Pop in Alexa, her soothing voice recognizes my call I tell her to shut up She does 4k HD, though my TV is only 720p It makes me feel small until I see My mine craft empire, my shovel knight fight Dolby from my controller, Amazon got this one right Ok, I think I'm done for now. If you like my poem please thumbs up, or if not thumbs up and I'll fix it. But really guys, this think is a no brainer. I'm 3 hrs into the new Gaming Edition and I am floored, everything is silky smooth. Now I'm not a tech gUru and I don't have the latest greatest anything, the only thing that's curved is my belly and the only thing that's 4k is my credit card balance (thanks prime), but I have used the Fire TV ever since it was released and I loved it.  I can even watch the screen saver for over an our and just melt into the couch. Amazon has a winner here.  Headphone jack in the controller? Thumbs up.  Controller is sleek and styling, comfortable and smooth. I have the Echo as well, and so I can tell you Alexa is a winner. She listens well, usually does as told, and she even has a sense if humor.  It's almost like someine else is there, or maybe I have lost my mind. Though, the Alexa-powered voice feature on the now TV-connected boxes is nice, unfortunately it won't be as robust as what's available in the Echo. For example, you won't be able to tell your TV to turn off your lights. Anyhow, back to the fire TV.  It's worth the upgrade Folks with regular HDTVs can take advantage of the Fire TV's support of HEVC (high efficiency video coding) for higher quality 1080p streams at lower bit rates. Amazon says that HEVC is roughly two times more efficient than the standard h.264.The new box also supports 802.11ac for better long-range performance, has 75-percent more processing power and a GPU that's twice as fast. All that extra silicon strength is for the company's updated focus on making the Fire TV a low-cost console for mobile games on your TV. To further convince you to start playing games with the device, Amazon not only updated its game controller with a more ergonomic design, voice control and headphone jack, but it also introduced this here Fire TV Gaming Edition. This $139.99 pack comes with a Fire TV, controller, 32GB microSD card and two games (Duck Tales and Shovel Knight). I don't see the price coming down, it doesn't need to, it's very competitive. So no need to wait. For your reference I have attached screenshot of the developer hardware specs. It's a huge upgrade, so take the plunge and gift the old one or sell it off, you'll be happy you did. If my poem or review helped, please thumbs up.
p	Great system. My sons love the gaming and I love how easy it is to use. Installation was a breeze for somebody like me who is NOT techy. It was already registered with my account so that was one less step.  The voice search is easy to use and I like the parental controls.  My favorite part was saying goodbye to my cable bill!
n	I have already had to manually shut down and restart this new edition of the Amazon Fire TV MORE times than I did on the previous model (which we owned since its release). Not impressed. We are pleased that our previous remotes work with this new edition (our stick remote AND our joystick remote), so we're now enjoying three remotes on this single device. I MUCH prefer the stick-remote over the joystick remote for casual video viewing. Haven't noticed anything significant in the hardware upgrades in this device - especially with an every-other-day needing to power down and restart the device. I would love to be contacted by Amazon with any suggested remedies.
n	1. Not able to access all functions with the included remote. To access custom resolutions, you need to press up and rewind for 5 seconds with a regular remote. The gaming remote does not have this ability. I had to pair the remote from my FIRE STICK to get to this menu. This is unacceptable. Amazon does not provide a way to get to a menu function with the included remote. That is like saying this is a ferrari, but it will only go a maximum of 20 miles per hour unless you buy a $40 key to make it go faster. It would be ok if the GAMING remote was OPTIONAL, but in this case it is mandatory. 2. 24hz does not work. Through that menu, I select 1080p 24 hz, but my TV shows that the box is still outputting the default of 1080p 60 hz. I still have to use my 3 year old WDTV LIVE STREAMING for 24fps.
n	What is the purpose have having a bundle if you are going to remove items from it?  My issue with this bundle is that the basic Fire TV is $99 and comes with a voice remote. This bundle is $139 and comes with a controller and no remote.  So if we were to do the math and add the $39 controller we would expect the voice controller to be there right? no.  Even after dealing with customer service they aren't willing to provide part of the product you are already paying for.  Save your money! buy the regular fire tv then the gaming controller! This is not a deal!
n	This is a very nice TV addition that allows almost seamless use of Amazon Prime and Netflix, you also get additional free TV channels that are nice to have. It sets up in minutes and because of the ethernet wired connection the picture quality is great (better than a wifi connection). The only things I am disappointed about are: 1. Gaming - This system is not ready for gaming. I looked at available Amazon Fire TV games and it's quite a list. But most are not compatible with the new system. 2. Price - I should have waited a couple of weeks because the price went down during the Black Friday deals. 3. Game Controller uses up batteries very quickly, I have had the system since November and changed batteries twice. My recommendation is do not get the gaming addition - the system is not ready for gaming (no quality games!!)
n	Quick Observations: 1) Be careful to note this does NOT come with the standard voice remote, only the Game Controller.  While you can use the game controller as a voice remote I quickly learned that it is not immediately responsive if it has sat for a little while unused (say 22 minutes while watching a show).  It appears to need to reconnect to the Fire TV, likely a power saving feature.  This is kind of frustrating as I'm used to the immediate response of pressing a button on the old Fire TV remote.  I personally like the look and feel of the voice remote for controlling the FireTV, and would prefer to only use the gaming remote when playing games.  I feel silly using a game controller to launch Netflix with company. 2) The new Fire TV supports 4k, but does NOT support HDR 4k.  Apparently this is due to Amazon's decision not to support the latest 2.0 HDMI standard.  It supports HDMI 1.4 only.  What's more, this also means it doesn't support 4k above 30fps either.  This is disappointing as well, as I was hoping this would be the solution for my 4k needs, but find that it doesn't quite get where 4k needs to be in my opinion. On the whole, the Fire TV is still good.  If you don't already own a FireTV and want one, get this one over the previous generation, but understand its limitations in the 4k realm.  Also, be sure you know what you want when it comes to the remote.
p	Fantastic book, fantastic characters and a fantastic pace of writing (not too fast nor slow). It has some great quotes, really inspiring. My only wish would be to turn back the clock, and read it all over again, for the first time.  Only if that was possible. If you have not read this book yet, I envy you. Since you would be reading it for the 1st time.
p	Perks of Being a Wallflower is probably one of the best books I have ever read. Charlie (the protagonist) is not a teenager you come across every day. He doesn't have any friends, and is evidently depressed. He meets Patrick and his step-sister Sam, and discovers a world he had not seen before. A world of drama, sex and violence. The language is very simple and clear, and a bit innocent, but honest. You'll fall in love with Charlie. Definitely pick it up if you like to read something that is thought-provoking. A lot of people I know didn't like this book. Maybe it was because they couldn't relate and found it boring. It's not fast paced, yes. But it's one of those short reads that demand that you think and let them seep into your mind.  If you're someone who looks for cheesy dialogues or boys that make you fangirl over them in books, do not read it.This book does not have huge plot twists on every other page, neither it has humour which will make you laugh your pants off. All it has is purity, and the things you don't see often, but the things most of you know exist.
p	This one made me cry at times, smiled at others. And often it stirred up so much that I had to put the book down to think for a while. And at times, I was shocked at how it could capture the undefinable subtleties of certain emotions. It's not that great a technical writing, but a touching one still. A good & touching story. The typesetting on this edition could've been far better.
p	In 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', the author, Stephen Chbosky , poignantly brings out the life story of a teenager, Charlie. From being a wallflower and finally being a man of his own action , the book is must-read for all such teenagers for it not only narrates high school life but also brings out all those roller-coaster days which are part of growing up. It is one such story which any teen can relate to his everyday life. When Charlie says, " At that moment, I swear we were infinite." that is when one can truly understand the meaning of the title. How eventually Charlie makes the best of his company, makes the reader yearn for having such friends. The question that why the book has received critical appreciation from diverse media will  only be answered after having read it. So, Happy Reading!
p	The protagonist Charlie is just lovely. There's so much innocence in his writing. The whole book is written in the form of letters to an anonymous friend. All in all a very good coming of age story about friends, high school and some tragedies of past. A must read !
n	“I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.” This book seemed to hold so much promise, with an interesting take on what it means to be a teenager, complex characters and meaningful message that would make you stop and think about how you perceive ordinary things. At least, that's what i expected when i walked into this book and i did get it...well, to some extent at least. At times, this book really does relate with you, having moments that make you wish you were given the same consideration and patience that you would give to others. Even though it follows only Charlie’s narrative, it really did point out that almost everyone has their own issues and everyone is going through things that we can’t relate to. But one of the main things that made me give this book 3 stars is the fact that it quite plainly points out that you dont have to relate to other’s issues and problems to be there for them. And sometimes, being there for someone could be something as simple as making friends with them at a party. With all the hype surrounding this book, and even after watching the movie, i assumed that the book would be better. After spending years and years of hearing about what a masterpiece this book is, I expected so much more. I’ll get straight to the point on this one. This book was manipulative, for lack of a better word. Drugs, abuse, homosexuality, child molestation and so much more are crammed into this book for the sole reason of angst. I’m not really one to say that there aren't people in this world who go through all of them, but the practicality of each issue and its significance on Charlie’s and his friend’s character development are all skimmed over so that another ‘angst-inducer’ can be crammed in. Its almost as though all those issue were introduced in the plot just so the readers suffer from this kind of “secondary sadness”, which keeps them hooked to the book hoping that their characters will get a happy ever after. All the plot tropes in this book are solely used when convenient, and never mentioned again. Another thing that bothered me about this book was the way the author depicted girls through Charlie’s point of view. All of Charlie’s letters portray Sam as a perfect, pixie dream girl. And yet, all the other women he knows, except his sister are depicted as vapid. Sam wasn’t Charlie’s miracle, she wasn’t his savior, and she sure as hell doesnt exist to further Charlie’s plot. I hated, hated the way women in this book were treated. Even all the problems his parents and sister had felt as though they were introduced in the book just to make things harder for Charlie. It’s almost as though everyone’s issues and pain in this book was just another way for the author to further Charlie’s narrative, because of which almost all of the other characters end up being one dimensional. I’ll admit, I really enjoyed reading this book a few years ago, and it did make an impact on me. But looking back, it feels like i read a 200 page soap opera with never ending issues but no solutions, all narrated by a guy who in my opinion, the author made really childish for extra brownie points.
n	As always the product was delivered before time which is really good.....but I've been recommending this before as well that the packaging should be done using harder material because otherwise the books get folded which happened with me....was really sad when I saw the book folded...I hope amazon will not disappoint me in terms of packaging the next time...otherwise I love amazon....the story of the book is also good...
n	I don't get what's the hype is all about. For me, this book was totally boring. I still kept reading it, hoping for an interesting twist. But nothing happened. And there came a point in the story when I had to give up reading it. I couldn't read anymore. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I didn't get the idea of the book. But the plot is really really boring. Maybe the movie would help me!
n	Not usually a fan of this genre but I managed to get through this rather easily. I was drawn to the cover more than anything else....apart from the fact that Miss.Watson is featuring in the film adaption. A reasonably good read that you can get through once. I do like the style though....
n	I ordered this book as it was highly recommended to me. But as it was I didn't like it very much. It is a very slow book.i liked it but not too much. Seriously overrated. A hint:it is in the form of letters
p	Every youth to start with reading a book like this,it helps morale building to all the ages .The essence neeti revealed by the great Chanakya ,the great philosopher,and splendid management mentor .
p	The book contains the valuables of Chanakya(Vishnu Gupta). In this fast moving world everyone must read this to stop a little, relax and then proceed the life with faith, courage, love and enjoy the rest of the life. He is really a genius to study human and give us a good set of Valuables. The book is presented in simple english so that all can understand very easily the fact. Good Luck to all. Enjoy every moment of your life.
p	very thoughtful and contains which are very relevant to practical life. Practical Facts presented Practically in simple and lucid language
p	That's called lifes lessons. Always my ancestors used to say "Don't be a kshathriya be a Chanakya".. And now I really understand whats meant by that. Good book. Just buy it. Don't think of slokas coming in between . Only the essence of what he said is needed and not how he said.
p	This book takes us to the real scenario in India during the period of first century before and after Christ by telling us how people had to battle and save themselves from bad people and different circumstances. It is not a book to learn morals but good for a historical study.
n	the book contains poems as it looks boring to watch but after going through the meanings it really sounds good as it has a great morality....
n	This book is decent read Mostly translations. Could have been better, if more things are described based on context. Never the less decent buy.
n	Bought to this book because I was (and I am) interested in the Chanayka Neeti. The original neetis in Sansrit, their pronunciation in English and the translation is mentioned as well. I read this randomly from whatever interested me (meaning not from start) and found it useful and to the point.. The author has done a good job of translation and selection of the Neetis. He could have made it more interesting though by explaining and linking up some contradictory strategies but for a price of a dollar, this book is worth its price.
n	I had bought the Kindle version of Chanakya Neeti. The rating of 1 star is for the format and not the content of the book. The slokas which are written in Sanskrit are not readable in Kindle.
n	the paper quality disappointed me, apart from that Chanakya neeti is something i had been craving all my life. he is the true teacher and his sutras and teaching are very well described in this book.
p	Have you ever felt like you are meant for something but have never got around doing it ? Maybe because it goes against the expectations that others have from you or against the conventions that the society you live in has set. If you have ever felt dissatisfied, bound by rules that you don't understand then this book is for you. This is a story for people who follow their dreams and make their own rules. They are not afraid to fail, not afraid to break the shackles of society, family and are ready to come out of the darkness of the unknown into the known. Jonathan Livinsgton Seagull, at first glance looks like any other typical seagull except that he unlike other seagulls, wants to fly and perfect his skills. While the other seagulls think that flying is just to facilitate the search for food, Jon knows that flying is more important than this. "For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly." So despite warnings from his society, warnings from his family he flies and achieves the highest speed ever flown at by any seagull which also proved that the gulls now could learn flying and eventually catch better fish instead of relying on the stale food they got from boats or the fish they captured from shallow shores. The flock, however, turns a blind eye to him and banishes him "..for his reckless irresponsibility," and "violating the dignity and tradition of the Gull Family.." But does he let go of his passion to fly, his zest to perfect his skills and drown in his sorrows? The answer is No. Jon continues practicing alone and experiences a spiritual awakening. The story, written in 1970, was a big hit and continued to be in the best seller lists for a long time. Its still very much relevant even more so in today's scenario where everyone is living to please someone, ignoring their own aspirations along the way. A short story, very simply written but with some very artistic photographs of seagulls by Russell Munson. This is a book that inspires and challenges to let go of the chains we bind ourselves in and explore the possibilities even if they challenge us to go in directions contradictory to the norms because "we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome." Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a must read book and I give it a 4.5 out of 5 for its simplicity, some memorable dialogues, beautiful photos of seagulls in flight and the heartwarming way in which Jon ultimately reaches perfection giving the reader hope and a new determination to achieve everything they thought impossible or against culture/ societal rules. As it says in the book "Don't believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is limitation. Look with your understanding. Find out what you already know and you will see the way to fly."

p	The metaphorical story reveals four important rules 1. always aim higher 2 never give up 3, help will come to you 4 try to pass on the skill irrespective of welcome .
p	This is too small back but the knowledge it encompasses is tremendous. The moment I turned to first page I linked myself to the seagul, and though every word is so simple yet so impact, that I kept sitting amazed once I done with the book. The author made very simple thoughts into powerful one liners which we all know but somehow afraid to face. In fact this book goes beyond defining moments that are beyond comprehension make available to you. If you read it as a small story, I guess better ignore it but if you really seeking serious answers go for it.
p	This book comes with a subtle message of living your dreams and passions. We aren't born to live the life of another person. Everyone is special in its own way and this is what the book wants us to learn. A very tiny book with a real message
p	This is one of the most inspiring book. It talks about thinking out of the box and aiming for your dreams. Must read at least once.If you can relate yourself with Jonathan then you will understand the message in the book. Very nice book.
n	Boring. Half of book is pictures of Seagull. Rest half is only one paragraph repeated again and again that seagulls should explore. Only low cost was a solace to me.
n	theme is too good! However, this book seems to be a short cut of some original book. So, I felt that some links are missing. Is it?
n	This Is Very Short Version of original Text therefore as a reader it is nearly impossible to decide.
n	Will surely help you to stand out from others and find jonathan within you . . . . . .
n	Though paper quality is good, image quality is extremely poor.
p	This is nice option for tracking your daily activity status. The android app or windows app gives good dash board and some very nice graphs to make you feel happy for the progress. The options for tracking I am not sure how accurate are these. I wear this while driving to office and in 105 minutes drive this watch shows anywhere from 16 - 20 floors climbed and around 4500 steps takes (agree Bangalore roads are bad and have lot of pot holes, but to give this kind of result ??) Not sure how this captures the floor climb, as I DO NOT climb a single flight of stairs, but everyday it show some 5 - 6 floors climbed. One more strange thing for this is the active time, not sure how this is measured. This shows steps taken around 9500 in a day and the active time as 15 minutes only. Where as I use my Samsung Galaxy S6 while walking and that shows approximately the time I was walking as active time, though the number of steps taken is quite different in my Samsung Galaxy S6 and Fitbit. The thing which I like most on this is the sleep meter, everyday morning it shows me how well I have slept and using this just an irony I am having more better sleep then the better activity :)
p	Have been using Fitbit surge for a almost a month now and I must say it is a wonderful product. It's gps is quite efficient at mapping your run and the heart rate monitor combined with the various exercise modes makes for a very versatile fitness tracker. It's also great to study your run patterns and your pace. Must buy if your an avid runner
p	This is a horrible horrible device that is going to make you its slave by driving you out of your couch. You will have to get off your butt and exercise to feed the monster.  You may end up healthy.
p	Pros: *** GPS Tracking- See distance, pace and elevation climbed & review routes and split times *** Get continuous, automatic, wrist-based heart rate and simplified heart rate zones *** Track workouts & view workout summaries; plus all day activities including steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed and active minutes *** Monitor your sleep automatically and wake with a silent alarm *** See call and text notifications on the touchscreen display *** Sync stats wirelessly and automatically to your computer and over 150 leading smartphones *** Utilize the sizing tool in Product Details below to ensure proper fit *** Kindly contact Fitbit for any technical issues *** Many factors can contribute to your tracker's battery not charging, including: Dirty charging contacts *** Faulty charging sources (e.g. USB port or plug) *** A defective Fitbit charging cable *** A defective tracker not accepting a charge *** Maximize training, maintain intensity and monitor calorie burn with automatic wrist-based heart rate monitoring *** Make the most of your day by getting more out of your night. Surge automatically monitors how long and how well you sleep *** Built with eight-sensor technology and best-in-class battery life, Surge transitions seamlessly from workouts to tracking real-time stats *** With multi-sport functionality, Surge lets you track every aspect of your training. Designed with advanced smartwatch features, Surge lets you run your day, your way *** 1 year Manufacturer Warranty from the date of purchase *** Holds a charge for several days (including working out) *** Good data tracking for general workout data. Cons: *** Occasionally I have problems syncing when the battery is low. I have to reboot the watch and the problem is resolved. *** I don't really trust the heart rate monitor, but that is not a big deal for me. *** When I am doing a "lap run" the display will only go back and scroll to show the last 8 or 10 laps, not sure the exact number at the moment. *** When I run more laps than that is will show lap 4-12 or whatever. Slightly annoying when I'm in the field training. *** The face is very thick, it makes it difficult to wear a button cuff, dress shirt. Please Hit the “YES”  button If you found this Review Helpful. It encourages me to inspect more and more products so that you could have only the Right Products.
p	Ordered by wife as a gift . initially was hesitant to take delivery because we ordered for large size and were worried if large is going to be oversize for my wrist  but however despite best effort to stop shipment it got delivered. Using it since last week and loving it Packaging is excellent Product quality is Excellent GPS is accurate App of Fitbit is  Wonderful Only issue  whichh I found should need improvement is the baytery back up . my surge lasts just two days with GPS on morning run tracking and synchronisation thrice. Therefore i am holding back one star..... Overall best value for money and it will motivate you to stay fit with accurate feedback of health parameters
n	I have bought  this product on 6th July 2015 as a replacement to my tomtom multisport watch (incidentally bought on Amazon ) as i wanted a watch with GPS and also other trackers such as  heart rate , steps and calories. Was impressed with the features  described in Amazon. However, the watch has lot of limitations on the GPS and running side, which is the primary requirement. I usually run on mapped  routes (i.e., where i have already run with other gps devices and know the exact distances) and found wayward readings (which i could see on the watch also). My some what detailed review is below. Pros: Watch with GPS, built in optical HRM ( so no belt required), steps, calories and also other exercises such as walk, yoga, pilates, biking etc (no swimming though). Good batttery life and also touch screen. Cons: GPS is inaccurate. Ran with the watch and once exported, the data in the map shows atleast a 10% variance with the track running over walls, sea etc??  this is a major drawback, where as my tomtom multisport especially on the gps front is unbeatable. Have escalated this to fitbit and also understand from the online forums that a new firm ware upgrade is on the cards, but not sure whether the gps inaccuracies is covered and rectified. the fit bit team also is continuously buying time, but rectification does not seem to be forthcoming.  this is the most critical feature and the inaccurate gps is a big let down. My tomtom is very very accurate in this aspect. steps : feel is a bit exaggerated as it some times captures your movement in places like auto rickshaw etc. I feel that overall if the gps experience can  be improved, only then the product is  a value for money.  Amazon, really disappointed that a sub standard product is being sold in your market place. P.s.: have just updated the firmware, but no use. gps is still faulty. Update as on 18th July , had raised the issue with the company and had to really fight with them on the device's issues as they blamed it on the weather, sky, etc and gave them adequate proof vis a vis other devices. . After escalating this to the top management, finally the company has taken notice and has assured to take this up and has started some work. I have shared the various faulty routes generated by the device along with the screen shots and also have marked right routes in maps and given them. There seems to be an improvement in the accuracy , though not very marked. Will keep every one posted. So , am upgrading the device from 2 stars to 3 stars. 24/7/2015 Revising the rating to 1 star,  no response  from company on any of the queries raised so far.  GPS was grossly inaccurate today. Update as on 21st August- its been forty days since i raised the query of faulty gps, the company has made me work for providing map data of my run by plotting my course etc., but no resolution, the map of my run of 16th august shows that i have run more than ten kilometres in the sea. My update as on 29th August 2015, Company has replaced the faulty device on 27th August, the gps  is working much better in the replaced device.Tested this in the walk, run and bike mode.  I will be testing the device and posting a review after sometime.
n	The readings are very erratic also the distance covered in actual and according to watch is not the same. Fit bit should definitely try and updating the  software , Even for the heart rate the conventional heart monitor show different readings.
n	So why I hate this super famous device? Well just look at the pics I have uploaded and you would know why. Within a month of usage I got rashes all over my wrist. My skin became red, then started itching, then started peeling. And trust me I dont even remember when I last had a skin allergy, probably never coz my skin is quite thick! Then, I decided to test it on another's skin so I gave it one of my friends. Well, he got rashes that too within a couple of weeks. I even wrote to Fitbit a few weeks back but no reply from them too. Not even an acknowledgement! This is not what you would expect when you pay a bomb (20K) just on a fitness band! You expect a premium service for a premium product. Regarding the product features - Now I think the best in the market is Apple Watch (28K) or Pebble (21K) or Moto 360 2nd Gen (17K). To be honest, I bought this for heart rate monitor and weights mode but heart rate is a total disappointment. I compared it with Moto 360, Apple and Garmin's chest strap and found them A LOT MORE reliable and consistent. Even the display in SURGE is pretty basic with just the vanilla black screen, which taken to medieval era when you compare it with the likes of iWatch, Pebble, Garmin, VivoFit or Moto 360 2nd gen. I regret buying it to the T. Wish I had gone for any of those I listed than just following the mass, which we fondly say in India as Bhedchaal! This is my WORST online purchase ever! Amazon/Fitbit - If you are reading this, I want my hard earned money back! You should not launch a product that is harmful to human skin.
n	It's a good product no doubt in that. But for people who are more of a gadget freak rather than fitness freak, go with Charge HR, I have both and personally for daily wear I prefer a Charge than a surge. If you are kind of person who's not all into smart watches and don't know weather they'll be useful or not, the surge acts as a bridge for smooth transition. It shows call and notifications, which I find useful. Battery life  is at a acceptable 5days. Quality of glass and touchscreen feedback is on par. Rubber strap feels premium too, it's soft and comfortable, but rubber around the curve undergoes a bit of a fade which I'm disappointed with.
n	Just got this delivered today morning and I was super excited to start using it. I set it up as soon as I got it, and to my dismay, the battery isn't charging. When the cable is plugged in, it'll show the charging indicator, but the device dies as soon as the cable is disconnected. Basically, I can't even use it. I've contacted Fitbit support for any help, but if things don't work out, I'll be returning this. One star for prompt delivery by Amazon.
p	Its must buy fr all ladies...some pupil texted vim vs dettol...i have used both and liked both..wat i found is BOth r approx.

p	Alright but not concentrated
p	I purchased this product to get Amazon Super Value Day Offer: Get Rs. 250 Gift Voucher On Purchase Of Rs. 1000 I bought all the eligible items in the single order of Rs.1022/- on 1st December 2015 but didn't receive any gift voucher from QwikCilver. Please send Gift Voucher asap.
p	Dettol dish wash is good and cleans really well, that serves its purpose but I did not like its smell, it is strong and not anywhere close to sweet lemony aroma of other dish washes available in the market. I feel that the smell should have been mild and sweet.
p	good product after using it stop using vim liquid
n	Does the job, an o k product from dettol for dish wash, got it delivered on time by amazon ....
n	Good one.But shipping charges too high for this kind of product.
n	MRP of the product is only Rs 52 but you people charged Rs 60.
n	Poor quality. It looks as if water is mixed in the bottle.
n	Poor Broken and leakage. Product is good but
p	For the first time ever I used an hair remover cream after doing a lot of research on it. Was very doubtfull where it would work on dense hair growth, but very happy with the results. Very easy and time efficient, saves a lot of time and energy.Recommended to all who have dense hair growth. Wish they had larger tubes or bottle of the same.
p	Good product. There was mild irritation on hands when I applied it over my arms and elbows, but nevertheless it was very effective. The instructions says, the recommended time limit to apply and remove the cream is between 6-8 mintues, however, I found out that I was easily able to wipe down the hairs only after 10 mins. Any time before that, I always encountered certain discomfort and hair wont come out.
p	Mujhe aksar allergy hoti h hair remover creams pr ise nhi hui. Easily I remove. great product to buy ..
p	Thanks amazon Nice product I saved 3 rupees
p	*** Don't go for full directly, TEST YOUR SKIN REACTION by applying and removing the product to a small part of the area you wish to treat for a maximum of 5 minutes. *** If you experience any smarting/tingling during use, remove the product immediately and rinse thoroughly with cold water. *** Never apply on your balls and your groin hair a​t the same time. *** Don't let it reach your bum hole at any cost. *** It really hurts like a hell and makes you visit a Proctologist. *** Always maintain a time gap of 72 hours between two hair removal sessions on the same area. Be careful and do it carefully.
n	Kya m isse apne cheast ke hair b remove kr skta. Hu
n	Veet quality is coming down as before it was thicker cream now it is like liquid which finishes very quickly
n	It is a good product. But available in the market at same price.
n	I wish I could give zero stars to you
n	Good product n worthy buying..
p	Got the product at around 30 bucks below MRP and the product came along with a tennis ball. Still wondering how the seller gives this kind of discount. Did not find any flaw with the product. Good deal!
p	Boost is a nourishing drink with a delicious chocolate flavour. I also enjoy using the free tennis ball that came with the product.
p	The delivery was quick and the product is perfectly packed and quality was very good. But i think bournvita is better than Boost.
p	received on time and as described.  here to the product price keep on fluctuating in a single day too.
p	Thank you amozon... Manufacturing date also very nearly this month ....
n	If we compare the cost its reasonable than other sites and shops. However there is a hidden point. Here reduced price is for 450 grams jar and what is available in the open market is 500 grams jar for just little extra money. So, the final verdict is not worth it. This is costlier than others if we calculate, I am not satisfied. Will not order again.
n	cheap mixer in milk i suggest you please go organic like real coco they are available online but little high in price
n	The product was sealed and OK. But the manufacturing date was 6 Months Old and Expiry is I guess just 9 Months.
n	Taste is different, not much good product! Local sellers boost is a good taste better than this!
n	Who will buy this product as it can be easily available in any local store below it's MRP..
p	I bought this Pen Drive thinking its a class 4 product (4 MBPS write speed) But I was amazed to see that its not! I got a speed of 7.5 MBps while writing the data from my laptop (Asus, i5, 500GB, 1GB, USB 2.0, Windows 7 HP) to cruzer blade. So I decided to perform the tests. Here are the results: (Format - FAT32) 1. ISO file (Linux Mint 16 - 1.13 GB)  - Started with 4.5 MBps but in 10 seconds caught a steady speed of 7.5 MBps. 2. MP3 files (69 files - Total 1.1 GB) -  Started with 6 MBps and after 2 seconds, fluctuated between 6.8 - 7.4 MBps. 3. MP4 video (1 file - 400 MB) - Started at 6.8 MBps and after 3 seconds, speed was always above 7.2 MBps. 4. Zip Files (21 files - 281 MB) - Started at 6 MBps and then fluctuated between 6-6.5 MBps. 5. PPT Files (92 files - 141 MB) - Started at 4.8 MBps and then remained in between 5 - 5.5 MBps. 6. PDF Files (15 files - 52 MB) - Started at 7.5 MBps and remained constant.. >> Read Speed of this Pendrive is almost constant for above 6 files i.e 18 MBps - 20 MBps. Final Words: There are two possibilities 1. Either only my Pen drive is such a faster hunk, or 2. Sandisk has improved the write speed in this Pen Drive. GO FOR IT>>>
p	I bought this pendrive mainly because of the given deal price 259; also received the product within 2 days of order and packaging was good. Coming to the pendrive it's good for the given price; has average speed of 7Mbps (transferred few 300~400mb file to test the speed) which is decent for a usb 2.0 pendrive and the build quality is good. The main drawbacks i feel it has are i) doesn't have any led indicator, ii) taking this pendrive out from my laptop is quite hard, really have to apply force to eject it. But overall a good budget pendrive...
p	VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND OFFERED ME WITH GOOD PRICE.LOVE TO BUY AGAIN LIKE THIS. ADD SOME MORE PRODUCT ON INDIA SITE
p	I have used sandisk pen drive before, but lost that one somewhere. hence, ordered it again cause of my past experience with it, its just amazing, small and easy to carry, the transfer rates are very good. The secured vault software that comes with it is an incing on the cake. Its password protected and u can save all ur private files in the vault, so even if u lend ur pendrive to someone u dont have to bother of removing those private files and saving somewhere else :) I recommend this sandisk pen drive to all and amazon service is the best, giving tough competition to other big e-commerce sites, well done, hope they make it for the customers to buy from USA Amazon too :)
p	Coming to amazon made an amazing packing for a small product , great work  hope amazon will maintain this all the time
n	Today I received this product.When I plugged it in my computer I found , this is 14.5 GB. Could you please clarify on this?
n	hardware not strong , when user plug this pen drive many times its damage and out from warranty. so company give 5 year
n	transfer rate is low..............im getting only 3mbps on writing and 18 mbps on reading. but for this price you cant blame the product.............i brought it for 315rs
n	Received this pendrive in time. Amazon's shipping is excellent. Sandisk Cruzer Blade 8GB: Pros: -No cap. So no worries regarding loosing any. -Compact design easy to carry. -No slider or any moving parts. -Loop hole to put some carrying string. Cons: -Complete plastic body. Breakable. Extra care needed while using and carrying. -No LED. That's not a problem for me but it is for some. SPEED: Writing Speed: This pendrive is extremely fast for files upto 30 MB. The transfer takes within 3 to 5 seconds. But for files above 30 MB (for videos and movies) the speed falls to 5 MB/s. It is now be called a slow pendrive. Now, for smaller transfers like pdf, doc, jpg, mp3 and any other smaller files this pendrive is very fast but for multimedia files it becomes slow. Reading Speed: Don't bother about reading speed at all. It will never disappoint you. Reading speeds are always above 15 MB/s to 24 MB/s. Over all, this is a nice compact good-looking 8 GB pendrive for a reasonable price from Sandisk/Amazon/Elegant Stores That's all... Happy Shopping @ amazon.in.
n	The above item is good quality-wise and its perfect design. But I have a problem that is the greatest problem - it's showing up as 'Local Disk' on my windows 7 PC!! I bought this flash drive for using as the main purpose for clean installing my desktop's OS but this could not have been happened as the uploader softwares upload only on 'Removable Drives' but this pendrive is not so. I asked the SanDisk customer service where I found that this is not a bug! The pendrive is made for windows 8 and that's why .... very frustuating !! Company shouldn't make such pendrives . Same result was on windows XP SP3. Finally I'm gonna tell you what is good and what is bad. Pros 1. it delivers a good transfer speed 2. Very stylish body - it looks just awesome 3. Price is good (thanks to amazon) Cons 1. 'Local Disk' problem. ; That's it - this makes it bad So, if you are gonna use this pendrive for installing os don't go for it as ot can't be made bootable
p	The printer meets all expectations. Although I had a little trouble with setting up the wifi network. The seller Amv were quick to replace my piece after I got a broken one and did so with the utmost professionalism.. Great experience as always.
p	When I was planning to buy a printer for my small office, I had various options. There were different companies and different types. I asked a lot of friends and searched online too. But, it added to my confusion. So, lastly, I wrote down my exact requirements and that helped me in narrowing down to this printer. I chose this printer for the following reasons: 1) It is all-In-One printer which supports scan, copy and print 2) It is wireless, so saves me from wiring. I can place it anywhere in the office where there is power supply 3) Easy setup and ease of operation 4) Supports two sides ID printing 5) Prints in bulk, 1 toner can get you around 1500 pages 6) Excellent service support from HP So, anyone having similar requirements can go for this Printer. Thanks!
p	Excellent Printer. Does the job perfectly in both wired as well as wireless mode. Only -ve (if you say so) is the USB cable for wired connection between PC and Printer is short (may be around 1.5 M).
p	Superb printer with low price..Amazon transported without any damage
p	Very good value for money printer.  Got it for 11k at Supreme Computers S.P. Road Bangalore. Best part is the network capabilities.  Both me and my dad use the printer from different rooms, works like a charm over wifi. Didn't really need the scanner, but after buying it I scanned all the my old childhood photographs and have a digital copy on my hard drive which I carry wherever I go. Only thing I felt is missing is a closed paper tray.  In the tray that is provided, when the papers are left open, over time, they get dirty because of the dust.
n	the printer lack wireless app scan you can't scan on mobile app and on computer you can wireless scan and it doesn't have cover lid on the page insert area. this totally annoy thing as charging 10k for the printer. all these features are available in upper model for that hp ask extra money. tonner come half filled. it is better to buy samsung 2071w as it got all features including nfc and available in market for 9500 bucks only. hp being a leader showing arrogance to make people spend more rather providing all features
n	The product is faulty and HP asked us to Send the toner once and then again the complete device  to okhla ,when we asked about onsite warranty they said 3-4 working days to send engineers.... SERVICE is BAD
n	This printer was defective. Though from our side infomed to HP but the product still today are in unworkable condition so today we back that product after discussing with customers care of AMAZON
n	I expected wifi printer and its not being easy to print from ubuntu/linux as there is no software provided for linux. I should look to sell it and buy a good one in next 6 months.
n	Received today. Although I am not going to return it.  But this piece is not giving me the satisfaction of buying a branded product. The finishing , packaging seems compromised.
p	Its a very nice speaker in this price range. Superb Output, size is somewat big, connection wire is small, and it has 3.5mm wire . its a good buy :) drawback is : Seller wont provide u with the charger :( @Amazon Product is marked with MRP 175! Do Look Into This matter
p	Best Speaker in this Price Range..Superb!! Pro's:- (1) Has very good bass quality (2) Volume reaches above the expectations in this Price range (3) It can play around 3-4 Hours (4) Sound quality is really good & clear. (5) It Performs Best when connected to Mobile Con's:- (1) Cable should have been provided slightly long (2) Sound Slightly Distort's when played from Laptop But Con's are not a big deal looking at the Price point & Quality provided..(Recommended Speaker)
p	the size is too big and the sound quality is simply superb don't worry buy this product is very useful the sound quality is very very nice
p	awessome product but amazone wale loot re hai... i got the same speaker from EBAY.in for just 40 rs including shipping charges i feel lucky to have such a nice and high class product so cheaply..
p	It's a good choice.... Easy to carry along and sound quality is satisfactory.... To recharge u require any normal Samsung type charger which is not provided along with the speaker which is the only negative part..... Buts that's ok as long as u already have it.....
n	The sound quality is OK. The size of the speaker is big than what we assume from the picture - not really a problem! Not satisfied, as the charger was not provided for charging the speaker. The review says, the cable is shipped along with the package for charging. Not sure, why it was not provided for me in the package.
n	Hi, The batteries attached with this speaker can be changed with new batteries as it is required after use of certain period. Please suggest. Else I should treat this product as use & through like pen. Also can I play the speaker during charging time.
n	When its not a wireless speaker so why do you have it under wireless speaker category...i have bought it and now i got to know that they are not wireless.. This is just like you guys are playing pranks..
n	Don't buy it. This speaker is very worst product.Sound cracks when it is on full volume and even there is no bass in it.Bakwaas product.Buy at your own risk.
n	i got an old one.the charger point is inside it.so i couldnt charge it. atlast i contacted to electrical shop and they solved it for me.
p	For hostelities or college students living in flats, this is the best Wifi router you can have in the price range of 850-1000. It'll absolutely satisfy all your requirements! BUT one IMPORTANT thing, it doesn't support MAC filtering! MAC filtering is same as "only allow allowed devices to connect" option in your smartphone's hotspot! So other than registered users, others can't to connect to the Wifi even if they have the password. Nice excuse to keep some unwanted people away, isn't it? ;) Although you can keep your Wifi password protected (Which is a 'must-have) make sure you don't need MAC filtering option, discus it with users and then definitely go for this one as its the best one in this range if you want to use it in a limited area like a flat. The just-next variant with MAC filter option is 600L with ~250 bucks more. Enjoy :)
p	I got it about 20 days delayed from date of delivery.Which means the product having warranty of 1 yr was available for me @ 11 mnths warranty only.Gati couriers are not reliable. Dont trust on it. Now about the product:This wifi router is perfect for home or small office use.Its range is more than 40ft radius in simple standard rooms(10×12)ft. i.e. if your house has large rooms (15×20)ft or more then its range may be more(wifi ranges are more and strong in open and less cnjsted areas). Easy to install and use. I just plugged it and connected it with my android phone (via wifi) followed simple steps (as on its manual) and forgot about it.I keep it powered on all the time and there is no heating issue or any kind of connection problem since past 2 mnths i m using it.
p	I ordered on 26.05.2015 and received the product on 06.06.2015 (rather quick as my locality is interior) The product is very good. Signal strength is quite good. Portable and easy to assemble. 3 years warranty. Happy with the product. I would refer friends, must go for it.
p	Have been using this for more than a month. Has decent range and enough connectivity. It covers more than 1000sq ft area when placed at one end of the home. I have connected upto 3 wireless devices and it runs good. Using the inbuilt wizard, its pretty easy to connect to existing internet. However with two DHCP servers in the network, Google Playstore refused to load on Android devices. Found the following link which solved the issue. http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=40856.0 You don't need to invest in 300n or ac devices as long as you have internet speeds running into a few Mbps, and doesn't want to share your internet with neighbours. ;)
p	Absolutely loving it. I have a 850 sq ft 2BHK home, Have kept the Router in drawing room near the TV and the signal is 100% in all the corners except in Kitchen corner where it drops to 80% (Have couple of thick walls which might be causing this). Other than that, highly recommended, no heat issues, no drop in signals....have ran it overnight and for almost 1 entire day except power cuts and it has no problems. Have tested it using my laptop and smartphone already. Just go for it.
n	Great Wifi router. Strangely though Dlink has curtailed some of its good features from an older model DIR-300 for which i had bought this as a replacement.  My TeeWe HDMI video streaming dongle (similar to google chromecast) doesnt detect this router. The older DIR 300 did so without any issues. DIR 300 did have IGMP Multicast and Wireless enhanced mode, which is clearly missing in DIR 600. This product is a clear downgrade if you leave aside wireless N  apart from b and g which has been added. Bad one, DLink. Didnt expect this from you. Hope you release some firmware update.
n	Price: I bought this on 14 September 2015. The price was too high that time and i had to pay 963. However, my need was urgent and hence i chose not to wait. Usually you get it around 800-845. So if you are buying check for this price range or below and then buy. Quality: Product is pretty good. Has been working fine all these days. So no complaints. Range: Range is pretty good if you are on the same floor (home). However, the range is pretty bad if you climb one floor up/down. In such cases you might get one bar or none. So choose wisely.
n	The product from D-Link really disappointed. If u are living in 2bhk flat, then i think will be okay. but for a 3bhk its not that good. The installation was very hassling as i there is no informative user guide, had to call D-Link service care to get it installed, the cable supplied with the packet is very short, that means u cant place the router strategically to oneself convenience. The price which i got was amazingly low. But folks if u really want a good router to suit your home then go for some other routers if is holes a bit in your budget.
n	Got this one when my TP-Link router stopped working. This was a little bit costlier than the TP-Link one but I wanted to give it a try. When compared to that, I somehow felt that the speed while browsing is less than what I was getting with my previous router. Also it does not has a power toggle button at the back which could come in very handy if you want to restart your router. Signal strength is good; no issues with that and also installation was not a problem. I hope it is lasts longer than the previous one.
n	Read the reviews of other found them pretty good so ordered it but the unit that i got is really not worth it i am facing so many problems with it 1. Gets disconnected after 2 or 3 hours 2. Range is good but dont expect it give you coverage of multiple floors 3. 1 of the eathernet slot not working Only positive thing is that the customer service is very good they are well trained professionals who are very polite they tried a lot still thry were unable to help me with the issues
p	Very light weight and stretchable material mask ! My intention of using it was to get protection from cold and dust while driving in high altitude, and the item served the purpose perfectly. Covers neck too. If using along with driving glasses, then its little difficult, as the exhaled out breath, fogs the glasses.
p	The item is of good material but the size is little small. Though it stretches and fits the face but its a very tight snug leaving marks after long use. The fabric though is very light and breathable. The label on the mask says Alpinestar so obviously it is good and lives to the brand
p	1. It says, Alpinestars, but Im not sure 2. Fits my head comfortably, its tight to the right degree, but not uncomfortably so, my head is medium or a little larger than medium 3. The materials used are thin, very flexible, smooth and comfortable. But can tear if you're not careful 4. The eye slot is curved a little bit (upward), I wish it weren't, but it's no problem for me 5. The box is comes in is cardboard, small and has Alpinestars printed on it. The MRP is listed as 650
p	Its comfortable to wear. Though it takes a little time to get use to it, but after wearing it, my LS2 slides over my head like a knife in butter :P. No itching or suffocation. But i don't think it ll give much protection from pollution.
p	very good product but wat i found a con about is its makes u sweat very easily even when its not that hot but overall for using on bike its a very good one.Must have for those who go out in these harsh sunny days
n	Not stretchable material.....  Poor quality.....  But good delivery....  2 days after booking... Too small....  Not as that I used before.... One star is for the delivery...
n	Worst quality, waste of money. does not meet any of the things specified in ad. 2 days i used it,  and i got allergic reaction on my face. Plz plz don't buy this product
n	Material is not good enough for the purpose. There is a stitch in the front part which covers the face. It irritates while driving.
n	size is too small, breathing is difficult, suitable for 10-15 years teenagers,not extendable,very irritating,
n	it is not at all good..quality is poor..also it is small.worst purchase ever on amazon
p	I wantd something for daily wear.these were good and the size is as xpectd
p	V.K.Jewels are really awsom.
p	I like ths vry much..
p	Excellent quality
p	Very good. Items
n	The size of the earrings was disappointing. Much smaller than the image portrayed in the website. Not worth the cost price.
n	Precise product specification should be mention. In such case, instit of 'Bali' Earring should be mention
n	Not satisfied...both earrings are different from each other by size
n	Golden colour started vanishing.It will be discolour in few days.
n	looked good at first but started to fade soon.
